Dear esteemed president of the Furry Friends Forever Cat Cafe.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,840
Ooh, hey you! Who's a good boy? You're a good boy!

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,400
Have you ever noticed how you choose different words depending on who you're talking to?

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,640
Let's take a look at how the context affects how a word is translated.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,500
In some languages, like French, there is a formal way to address someone and an informal way as well.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,160
For example, let's say I'm interested in addressing a friend and I told my friend,

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,140
Since you like eating salads, I will give you an apple for your birthday.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,240
In French, the informal way to say you is to.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:52,280
This T' here is short for te, which is the version of you that is receiving the action of the verb to offer.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,280
And this ton here means your.

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,840
When you're addressing someone in a special position,

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,960
such as a teacher, manager, or public figure,

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,740
you might use the formal way to address them.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,400
For example,

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,020
I told my queen, since you like eating salads,

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,240
I will give you an apple for your birthday.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,980
The formal word for you is vous,

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,160
and the formal word for your is votre.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,640
But if you look over here,

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,740
it appears that the translation is still using the informal word for you.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,340
So I'm going to hide what I'm changing for now because it will make more sense at the end of this video.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,660
But you can see on the right that now it's addressing the queen with the formal words vous and votre.

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,700
In real life, whether you're addressing your friend or addressing a queen,

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,160
this context affects which words you use.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,080
And machine translation models also use context to decide which word to use.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,480
Let's take a closer look at context in the context of machine translation.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,540
Here's that sentence addressing your friend in English.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,020
And here is its translation in French.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,820
So the word for you is tu, the other you is t' and your is ton.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,540
These are the informal versions of the French word for you.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,340
Here's that same sentence but now addressing my queen.

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,260
The French translation is this.

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,580
The word for you is vous and the word for your is votre.

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,580
This is the formal version of you.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,080
If you're a French speaker, you would pick up on the word queen to recognize that the word for you should be the formal version.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,020
For the machine translation model, the word queen is relevant context for the words you and your.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,640
The words surrounding any given word are called the context.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,140
You may have heard the word context before.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,140
For example, let's say a professional singer says,

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
For lunch, I ate a kid's meal.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,820
And then a gossip magazine publishes an article titled,

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,700
famous pop star heard saying, for lunch, I ate a kid. This is an example of the celebrity's

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,780
statement being taken out of context, because kid's meal is an important part of the context

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,120
of what that person was actually saying. But you may recall that the translation model did not pick

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,660
up on the fact that the queen might need to be addressed formally. So it's still using the

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,420
informal word to for you. So let's try to give the translation model more context. So again,

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,440
it's starting out with the informal words for you. Let's try to add the word formal in square

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,340
brackets after the first u. That doesn't work. Let me undo that so I can test out one change at a

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,220
time. Now I'll try to replace u with the formal French word vous. That also doesn't change the

50
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,200
translation. So I'll again undo this change so that I can test each change one at a time. Now

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,719
I'll change the lowercase q in queen to an uppercase q. It's still not enough context. Let's undo

52
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,140
everything for now. There's a saying I heard recently, which is everything, everywhere,

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,380
all at once. So let's try to use all three changes to give the translation model more context.

54
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,620
So let's change you to vous, add formal in square brackets, and capitalize the q in queen.

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,800
Et voilà! Finally, with all these hints, the translation app has now figured out that you're

56
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,419
asking it to use the formal words for you and your in French. And by the way, if you don't know what

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,079
"voilà" means there might be an app that can help you. The main point I hope you take from this

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,600
is to experiment with these models in order to better understand how they behave and also how

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,820
they sometimes don't behave. You'll start to notice how the apps that rely on machine learning models

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,180
are not always following explicit rules, so the changes I made here to get the effects that you

61
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,499
saw here may not be the only way to do it and also may not work in all situations. Next, you'll look

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,740
Look at the difference between translating a phrase word for word as opposed to translating

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,400
the meaning behind that phrase.

64
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,580
This will be fun.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,740
I promise it will be a slice of sweet baked dessert.
