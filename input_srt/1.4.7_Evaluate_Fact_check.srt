1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,280
*music*

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,040
Chatbots can also be used for evaluation.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,360
For example, you can use the chatbot to help with fact checking.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,000
Imagine this scenario:

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,240
You're writing to your friend on their birthday

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,560
about their birthday cake that you bought for them.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,840
Here's what you plan to say:

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,020
I dropped your birthday cake on the ground,

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,280
but don't worry, I picked it up right away.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
So according to the 5-second rule,

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,780
the bacteria didn't have enough time to crawl on the cake.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,620
Happy birthday!

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,000
Just in case, you ask a chatbot to evaluate this and check if it's correct before you

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,340
send it.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,540
So it looks like it helped fix some grammar and spelling issues.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,920
Okay, not bad.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,880
But that's more of a rewording and revising task.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
It's not evaluating the content of the written text.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,140
Let's get a second opinion.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,900
So in this case, this chatbot is checking the factual accuracy of the writing.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,739
It's pointing out that the 5 second rule is a common myth, and also points out that

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,760
the cake isn't necessarily free of bacteria. So that's pretty helpful to know. And just to make

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,140
it clear that you're asking a chatbot to fact check as opposed to checking wording or grammar,

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
you can ask, is this factually correct? And then you can give it the text that you want it to check.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,300
Let's go back to the earlier chatbot that had fixed the wording instead of fact checking. And now

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,940
it's also pointing out that this five second rule is a myth. And you can ask a chatbot to fact check

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,700
itself by asking it if it's sure of its previous output. You may recall this logic problem from

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,640
earlier in the course. After the chatbot gives its answer, you can ask a follow-up question. Can you

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,240
check your response to see if it is correct? And you may recall that this follow-up question is

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,560
called reflection, as you're asking the chatbot to reflect on its earlier output. So as you saw

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,200
before, the chatbot answers yes, which is incorrect. Now let's ask the follow-up question to check if

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,000
previous response was correct. And now, given a chance to reflect on its previous answer

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,320
and reasoning, the chatbot corrects itself and also explains its answer.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,040
So not only is it helpful for you as a human to fact check a chatbot and its output,

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,340
the nice thing is you can also ask a chatbot to help fact check other pieces of writing as well.

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,820
And maybe the next time you ask a chatbot to perform a task, you can also ask it to reflect

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,000
on its output and check if it's correct. Next, another way a chatbot can evaluate is by grading.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,880
And by that I mean check if a student's answer to a problem is correct or not.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Let's take a look at grading next.
