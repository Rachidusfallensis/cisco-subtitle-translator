1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,420
Sometimes you need to come up with creative ideas.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,120
Like for example...

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,380
Hang on a second.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,300
Let me ask a chatbot for help.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,740
In the meantime, let's take a look at how you can use chatbots to come up with creative ideas.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,620
Sometimes when you're trying to be creative,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,120
you can ask a chatbot to give you options to help you think of new ideas.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, you can say, "Tell me a joke about puppies."

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,660
So here it gave me one joke.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,180
Why did the puppy sit in the shade?

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,680
Because it didn't want to be a hot dog.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,000
But it would help to ask for more than one option.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,340
So you can say instead, suggest several options for a joke about puppies.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,240
So now you have a couple options.

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,280
Feel free to rewind a bit to read through all of them

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,800
or prompt a chatbot yourself to see what you get. If you find a joke you like and want variations

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,620
in a similar style, you can ask it to analyze the joke, explain why it's funny, and then suggest

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,820
some similar jokes. Why don't dogs make good dancers? Because they have two left feet. So I

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,060
can say explain the structure and what method it uses to make the punchline be funny or interesting

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,500
and then suggests some jokes that use a similar method for the punchline.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,360
And here, it identifies that two left feet is an idiom in English,

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,140
which describes when someone maybe isn't so coordinated and therefore not very good at dancing.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,220
And then it tries to suggest some jokes that have the same type of wordplay that you saw in the first joke.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,500
So for example, this joke, why did the scarecrow win an award?

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,380
because he was outstanding in his field.

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,320
And it explains the joke, because outstanding in a field

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,400
is a play on the literal idea of a scarecrow standing in a field.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,440
So I encourage you to try this out for yourself.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
Either pause the video now or wait till the end of the video,

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,420
and you can analyze some jokes and see if you can prompt a chatbot

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,700
to suggest some jokes that have a similar style or setup.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
Here's an example to get you started.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Here's this joke about eating salads and cakes that you may recall from earlier.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,920
And I'm actually a bit curious if you find this funny or not,

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,080
because I've tried this on a couple people and got mixed results.

36
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,600
But at least it makes me laugh when I tell it to myself.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,820
There's also this funny phrase that I came up with.

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,840
I wish I remembered what I was thinking when I was inside the box.

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,060
Or this one, which I read somewhere online.

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,660
I wish I paid more attention in my first rodeo.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,760
And don't worry if you don't get why this is supposed to be funny, maybe you can ask a chatbot to explain.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,800
And maybe after you try asking a chatbot to tell some jokes or explain some jokes,

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,560
you can decide for yourself whether you think AI has a sense of humor or not.

44
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,140
You may recall that chatbots sometimes hallucinate,

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,220
especially when you ask it about yourself if it doesn't have information about you.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,240
You can treat this behavior as a feature instead of a bug if you ask it to daydream about your future life journey.

47
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,120
For example, you may be planning your next steps in your career, maybe you're starting

48
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,920
out in your career, and it helps to read other people's biographies to get a sense of what

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,140
kind of life you want to live.

50
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,280
And it might also be fun to read an inspiring story about your future self.

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,920
And you can customize this story based on your personal interests and hobbies.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,620
I'll start out by giving the chatbot a role as a fortune teller who tells inspiring stories

53
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,060
of a person's future life.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,880
And I'll give the fortune teller some background info.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,900
the person's name, Francis, Ko, their interests, hobbies, and values.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,140
I specify the pronoun because it sometimes tends to default to he and him unless you specify this.

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,260
So let's see what the future may hold for Francis.

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,920
If you want, you can try this on yourself with your own hobbies and your own personal interests and passions

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,480
to see what the chatbots tell you might be in your future.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,780
And I hope it might give you some inspiration for what you want to do next.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's go on to the next video to learn about one of these synthesized tasks, which is to summarize text.
