1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,280
If you try to be good at one thing, it might be really hard.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,340
But what if you're pretty good at two things or maybe even three things?

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,900
Let's take a look at skill stacking and how you can use that to your advantage.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,580
At some point in your life, you may have had some well-intentioned person tell you

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,660
to drop your hobbies so that you can focus on skills that will help you get a real job.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,760
For example, you may have an interest in baking or sports or gardening.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,240
Perhaps you have an interest in acting, telling jokes, or maybe writing short stories.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,100
Maybe you really like playing music, painting, or singing.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,800
Maybe you like dancing or fitness and health.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,640
Maybe you're really into making pictures or making fun videos.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,180
And the so-called professional skills you may also be trying to grow might be things like

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,060
math or coding, some other business-related skills, maybe medicine or healthcare, maybe

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,900
some of the sciences like physics, chemistry, or biology.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,920
Maybe you're studying to be a journalist or marketing.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,540
maybe working in hospitality and tourism, maybe you're studying to be a teacher. Sometimes you

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,220
may feel the pressure either from other people or from yourself to drop your hobbies so that you can

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,420
focus on your career. But maybe there's a way you can find some way to integrate your hobbies into

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,520
your career. Let's learn a little bit about skill stacking to see how this might work. You may have

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,500
many skills that you already have or are in the process of developing. It's kind of like having

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,120
several different kinds of utensils like spoons, forks, knives, chopsticks available to you when

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,720
you're ready to eat a meal. And depending on what kind of meal you might have today, certain tools or

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,100
utensils might be better to allow you to make the most of that meal. The idea behind skill stacking

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,740
is that instead of trying to be really really good at one skill, you might actually stand out more

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,760
if you're pretty good at a unique combination of two or more skills. So you could drop your hobbies

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,000
and try to be really, really good at one thing, like pursuing your skills in medicine.

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,040
And another path you might take is to combine a couple skills, including medicine, dance,

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,000
maybe your interest in video editing.

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,880
For instance, maybe you apply your understanding of dance to specialize in physical therapy

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,899
or fitness training for other dancers.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,260
And maybe you take your hobby of editing videos to help you create fun videos on social media

31
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,840
to help educate others about fitness and health tips that can help dancers.

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,380
And you can find your own combination of hobbies and skills that you can apply towards a career.

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,760
One way you can think about how your combination of skills really sets you apart is by thinking

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,600
about how each of your skills fits in on a spectrum of technical or creative skills.

35
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,800
These aren't the only two ways that you can group your set of skills, but generally,

36
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,520
you can stand out if you have a mixture of both technical and creative skills.

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,220
So instead of dropping your hobbies to focus on your day job, you can think about how you

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,020
can apply your hobby to your day job. For instance, maybe you're really into photography and your day

39
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,480
job is a zoologist at a wildlife reserve. So perhaps you can apply your photography skills

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,620
to create a picture book about the animals that you're working with. Or maybe you're an avid dancer

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,520
and also a videographer. So you can apply your understanding of dance when you're filming and

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,880
editing videos for other people's dance performances. Maybe you're really good with editing and animating

43
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,560
videos and you can apply this to your job in marketing by creating fun marketing videos.

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,260
Maybe you're an artist and also learned coding, so you can apply this to your job as a video game

45
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,860
designer. Maybe you enjoy creative writing and you're also a computer programmer and you can

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,740
apply this to your work as a technical writer. Maybe you like telling jokes and doing stand-up

47
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,880
comedy, so in your day job as a teacher, you add in a few jokes to help your students stay awake.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,860
Maybe they like your jokes so much that when you do a stand-up routine, they all come and watch

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,780
and laugh at your jokes. Anything's possible, right? Coming up next, you'll get to combine,

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,920
or maybe even stack, a couple of the skills that you've learned in this course

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,440
to help you with some of your everyday personal or work tasks. The Open-Ended Project is next.
