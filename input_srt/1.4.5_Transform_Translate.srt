1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,140
You can use chatbots to transform text from one form to another. For example, you can also use

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,700
chatbots to translate from one language to another. If you took the machine translation part of this

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,380
course, you used it to translate an idiom or saying, and depending on the context, the translation tool

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,640
may have translated this into an idiom in the target language, or it may have translated this

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,840
literally. You can also use chatbots to perform translation as well. And the nice thing is that

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,680
you can ask it to translate to more than one target language at the same time. Let's see how a chatbot

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,760
translates the phrase "every cloud has a silver lining" into multiple languages. And here I'll use

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,120
Copilot. So it translates to Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Portuguese,

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,800
Hindi. And I've actually tried this out with multiple chatbots. Most of them do pretty well

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,200
with translating to Spanish. Here I'll look at the Chinese translation, and in this case it's

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,880
suggesting a phrase that looks a little bit more literal and is not the equivalent idiom in Chinese

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,700
that I'm looking for. But even if you're not familiar with the target language that you're

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,480
trying to translate to, you can ask a chatbot to help you out and check if it's providing a

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,759
translation that a native speaker would recognize. So you can ask a follow-up question: for the

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,000
For the Chinese translation, is this a common idiom or expression in Chinese?

16
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,580
If not, can you suggest common idioms or expressions that have the same meaning?

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,760
Let's see what it says.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,000
So now that it has a chance to double-check itself, the chatbot says that this is not

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,340
a common expression, and lists three expressions that might be more recognizable to people who

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,080
speak that language.

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,520
And the first expression that it suggested, 塞翁师马, 言之非福, means "a

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,920
a blessing in disguise. And that was actually the idiom that I was thinking about as the equivalent

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,680
to every cloud has a silver lining. And again, if you're not familiar with the target language,

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,860
you can ask the chatbot to explain what that idiom means. So for the next follow-up question,

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,880
you can ask, for the first idiom referring to the list that it just output, please give some

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,599
background on the meaning and origin of this idiom. And let's see what it says. And so it explains

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,600
that bad luck can turn into good luck and also the other way around. Good luck might turn into bad

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,900
luck. And it tells the story that is the origin of this phrase. It's about a man who loses his horse

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,680
and his neighbors say, oh, that's too bad. And he says, well, maybe it's not so bad. Then that same

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,960
horse that ran away came home and also came back with an additional horse, who I'm sure is just a

31
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,300
friend. So the neighbors say, oh, that's great. But then the owner says, well, maybe it's not that

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,200
great. Later, the owner's child is riding that new horse, the one who's just a friend, and accidentally

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,280
falls off and breaks his leg. So the neighbors all say, oh, that's too bad. But the father says,

34
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,420
well, maybe it's not so bad. Then one day there's a war, so all the young people have to go off and

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,480
fight in that war, and many of them get hurt or worse. But because the man's son had a broken leg,

36
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,180
The son was not able to go to war, and therefore he was able to stay home and stay safe.

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,860
So that's kind of a cool background story to the idiom.

38
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,680
And there's a lot of idioms in other languages that have similar meanings, as every cloud has a silver lining.

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,420
So I encourage you to ask a chatbot to identify idioms in other languages that have the same meaning,

40
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,020
and to explore the origins of those idioms.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,940
And the nice thing about performing translation with a chatbot is you're no longer just limited to

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,780
surrounding a phrase with certain keywords or phrases to encourage the translation service

43
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,500
to provide the idiomatic translation or alternatively the literal translation.

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,380
Now with a chatbot, you can directly ask it for the idiomatic translation

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,760
and even ask it to propose a couple different options because there may be more than one.

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,120
Let's now try to translate another idiom.

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,020
It's a piece of cake into French and ask for different options for expressions

48
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,560
that might have the same meaning.

49
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,800
And let's ask it to label each of these options as to whether it's a figurative or literal word-for-word translation.

50
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,680
So I'll go ahead and use Mistral, because they're based in France, and have an emphasis on the French language.

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,820
It first provides the literal translation, which is literally a piece or slice of cake,

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,060
and then it provides a couple figurative translations, including a game for children, as easy as saying hello,

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,600
and this is kind of funny, with a finger up the nose.

54
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,540
So which one might be more commonly understood?

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Well, you can ask the chatbot that exact question.

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,040
For these options, which are more commonly used in everyday language and conversation?

57
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,280
So here's what it says.

58
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,720
A game of children is listed first as the most common expression.

59
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,200
You can think of it as child's play.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,940
Followed by as easy as saying hello.

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
And followed by with a finger up the nose.

62
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,880
And as before, I do encourage you to try this out with a couple different chatbots

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,600
because they may give different results.

64
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,920
and it will help you to review a couple different chatbots outputs to help you decide which

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,660
translation to use. In addition to foreign languages, it might help to know that you can

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,000
translate into Morse code, which is an alphabet that you can signal using a mirror and some sunlight,

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
or even a flashlight. You might have seen this demonstrated in a spy movie, for instance.

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,640
So here's a scenario where this might come in handy. Say you're sitting on a beautiful tropical

69
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,600
island eating some fresh pineapples. In the distance, you see a ship in the ocean, and you

70
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,020
decide you want to send them a signal in Morse code with a mirror and the sunlight. Thankfully,

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,220
you took this free online course that suggested the benefits of downloading compressed language

72
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,120
models onto your personal computer, and you also have that same computer with you. So you turn on

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,640
the computer, and here's what you ask the chatbot to do. Convert the following text to Morse code

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,480
and break it down letter by letter. SOS, I'm stuck on a deserted island. And it's still good to

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,280
double check if this looks right to you. For instance, it looks like the letter S is consistent

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,520
here and here. And here's the letter O. It looks like S is a dot, two dashes, followed by a dot,

77
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,340
and O is three dashes. But let's double check this. So we can rewrite this prompt by adding this

78
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,500
to the beginning. List out the alphabet in Morse code. Then convert this to Morse code and break

79
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,040
down letter by letter. And here's the same message as before. Let's try this out. So here is the

80
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,200
updated prompt, and you can see that it's first listing out the alphabet in Morse code. And now

81
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,440
it's converting the message to Morse code. Let's scroll back up and check the alphabet for S and O.

82
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,620
So S is actually three dots, not what we saw earlier. O is three dashes, which is the same

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,500
as what we saw earlier. And now you can see that the message SOS looks like this. S is three dots,

84
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,060
Here and here, O is three dashes.

85
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,240
You can also do an internet search, and here in Wikipedia,

86
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,780
you can verify that S is three dots and O is three dashes.

87
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,280
So maybe you can practice how you might prompt a chatbot to

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,880
convert your message into Morse code, and your future self will thank you

89
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,700
when you encounter a situation where it's really useful.

90
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,480
Next up, you can transform text using chatbots in other ways as well.

91
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,140
Let's look at how you might reword and rewrite text.

92
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,660
Let's go on to the next video.
