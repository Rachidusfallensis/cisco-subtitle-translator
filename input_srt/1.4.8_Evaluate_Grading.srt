00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,620
One of the ways you could use chatbots for evaluation is by doing qualitative scoring

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,000
on things like essays. Let's take a look at how you can prompt a chatbot to help you with that.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,380
You can have a chatbot play the role of a teacher by helping you check your work

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,180
and help you think things through if you need some feedback. So given a problem you're trying

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,500
to solve, you first try out the solution yourself, then share it with a chatbot teacher. The chatbot

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,560
chatbot can first work out its own solution, compare it to the student's solution, and

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,940
if needed, give feedback and hints for how to reach the correct answer.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm calling this task "Grading" because you and the chatbot are working on a problem where

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,340
there is one "correct" answer.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,440
Here's the problem we're trying to solve.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,560
You may recognize it from earlier in the course.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,440
And for this example, let's have Meta AI play the role of the student.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,660
So here's the student's solution.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,260
And here is the grading task.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,920
First ask the chatbot to work out the problem on its own.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,700
Then compare its solution to the student's solution.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,220
Then decide if the student's solution is correct or not.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,340
If the student's solution is incorrect, give them some hints.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,400
Below that you can provide the original task or problem that the student is asked to solve,

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,080
and also the student's solution that's being graded.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,380
And let's use HuggingChat, which also hosts the Meta Llama model.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,500
So meta is grading meta.

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,700
That's so meta.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,500
Here's the start of the prompt.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,980
And let's copy in the logic problem.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,300
Then let's get the student solution and copy that in.

27
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:45,280
And let's see what happens.

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,120
Looks like the teacher chatbot incorrectly thinks that the answer is yes.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,440
And so it says that the student is correct and does not need any hints.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,140
So I tried this a couple times before filming, and sometimes the LLAML model as the grader

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,560
correctly figures out the answer is no and gives the student hints to get the correct

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,360
But sometimes the grader also gets it wrong, so I think it's helpful to keep in mind that

33
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,460
the grader might also get the answer wrong as well.

34
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,140
Let's try this again, but this time I'll choose another open source model also hosted

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,840
on Hugging Chat called QN, which is produced by Alibaba.

36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,180
So QN will now play the role of the teacher, and I'll repeat the same prompt.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,920
So in this case, looks like the teacher model works through the solution and correctly states

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,040
that the answer is no.

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,460
It then reviews the student's reasoning and compares it to the teacher's reasoning.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,580
It also explains why the student's reasoning led to the incorrect answer.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Finally, the teacher provides some hints to help the student figure out the correct solution.

42
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,360
So that's pretty nice.

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,360
Maybe you can try this out sometime when you would like some feedback.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,060
And for this example, maybe you can give the teacher's feedback back to the student chatbot

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
and see if that helps it get the right answer.

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,440
Next, let's look at evaluating someone's work when it's a more open-ended task, like an essay.

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,800
We'll look at qualitative scoring next.
