1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,420
Did you know that if you eat a salad every time you would otherwise eat a piece of cake,

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,880
you might see about a 10% reduction in how much you enjoy your life?

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,080
On that note, does AI have a sense of humor?

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
You'll find out as we explore chatbots together.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,140
As you get started learning about chatbots, I would like to give you just two vocabulary

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,300
words up front as you will hear them a lot.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,900
The input that you give to a chatbot is called a prompt, and its output is called a completion,

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,020
but you might also hear this referred to as a response.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,400
You'll learn a bit more about why the input is called a prompt and the output called a

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,420
completion a little bit later in the course.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,480
But for now, when you hear prompt, just think input, and when you hear completion or response,

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,020
think output.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,620
You may have already used chatbots before and realized that you can ask it for information,

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,160
like with a search engine.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,780
There's actually quite a lot that you can do with chatbots, so I would like to group these types of tasks into seven categories.

16
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:18,680
You can expand, you can synthesize, you can transform, evaluate, you can chat, take actions, and you can also input not just text, but also images with text into the chatbot.

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,520
Let's take a look at examples for each of these seven categories to see what they mean.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,300
By expand, I mean that you can ask a simple question such as, who is BTS?

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,320
And the chatbot will expand on that by outputting a lot of information about what you asked for.

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,340
And another way of expanding is asking it to help you generate ideas.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,220
For example, you can ask it to give you some suggestions for jokes,

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,760
or suggestions for places to go on vacation based on your personal interests.

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,680
So expand isn't a formal scientific definition,

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,040
but I use it to describe instances where you can give it a short prompt,

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,180
and the chatbot then outputs several paragraphs of information

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,040
or a list of suggestions for you to choose from.

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,060
So it's kind of expanding on your prompt.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,440
Here's an example of asking for information.

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,759
You can ask it, what's the difference between a golden retriever and a labrador retriever?

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,500
And you can see that it lists out differences based on different categories

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,380
like personality, health, and grooming.

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,080
And by the way, in natural language processing,

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,480
This type of task is called question answering because you ask it a question and it tries to

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,360
answer that question. And here's an example of generating ideas. I'll ask it to suggest some

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,260
jokes about puppies. And I thought this was pretty good. Why was the puppy so good at school?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,420
Because it was the teacher's pet. Another category is synthesize. For example, you can say summarize

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,139
this and then paste in the text of an article or some paper that you're reading. Another synthesized

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,700
task is to label text. Say you have many small pieces of text, like replies to a social media

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,520
post or a couple of online customer reviews of a product. You can ask a chatbot to label them by

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,140
topic or label them as having a positive or negative sentiment. And again, synthesize isn't

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,319
an official scientific term, but I'm using it in contrast to the expand task to describe scenarios

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,100
where you feed in a lot of information into the prompt, such as an article or several social media

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,300
posts, and ask the chatbot to distill or synthesize that information into something smaller and more

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,620
digestible. So here's an example of asking a chatbot to summarize an article about Labrador retrievers.

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,420
And here's an example of the other synthesized task, labeling.

46
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,480
You can ask it to give topic labels to the following three articles about Paris.

47
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,440
The next category is Transform.

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,840
For example, you can translate from one language to another language, which is the machine translation

49
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,620
task that you saw earlier. And you can also reword or revise a piece of text. Let's see what that

50
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,660
means. Here's an example where you can translate a phrase, every cloud has a silver lining,

51
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:35,160
from English into multiple languages at the same time. Pretty cool, eh? And here's an example of a

52
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,279
rewrite task. You can ask a chatbot to rewrite an article to use simple vocabulary that most people

53
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,860
can understand. So here's an article about corgis which uses big words and the chatbot rewrites or

54
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,060
transforms it using more commonly used vocabulary words. Another category of tasks is evaluate. For

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,760
example, you can evaluate if a statement is factually correct or evaluate an essay by giving

56
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,360
it a qualitative score. Here's an example of an evaluate task, fact checking. So I'm asking,

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,380
Is this an accurate statement? Since we only use 10% of our brains, only 10% of me was saying that

58
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,300
corgis are cuter than bulldogs. And the chatbot replies that actually we use much more than 10%

59
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,540
of our brains and that is a common misconception that we only use 10% of our brains. It doesn't

60
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,200
have any comments on whether it's correct to say that corgis are cuter than bulldogs.

61
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,059
I do want to mention early on that fact-checking goes both ways. You can have a chatbot help you

62
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,380
to fact check what humans say or write, and it's also very important for you as a human to check

63
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,380
what a chatbot outputs. You'll learn more about why later on in this course. Here's the other type

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,900
of evaluate task, which is qualitative scoring of something subjective such as an essay. So here I'm

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,660
asking the chatbot to evaluate the following short essays on a score of 0 to 10, where 10 is the

66
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,719
highest, and to also share why it gave those scores. So there's a paragraph trying to make the case

67
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,700
that dogs are better than cats as pets. And then there's another paragraph trying to make the case

68
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,140
that cats are better than dogs. And then finally a paragraph that says neither dogs or cats are

69
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,800
better. They're both great. And the chatbot outputs a score for each paragraph as well as an

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,780
explanation for each score. You can also chat with a chatbot. And by that, I mean you can have an

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,219
ongoing back and forth conversation. And there are ways you can start these conversations so that

72
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,180
you're not the only one moving the conversation forward, but you can actually have the chatbot

73
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,380
ask follow-up questions or take the initiative in leading the conversation. You'll learn more about

74
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,280
that later in this course. Here's an example where I'm initiating a conversation by talking about my

75
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,400
day. And it's okay if you can't read all of what's going on here, but the chatbot is also asking

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,239
follow-up questions and making suggestions for what I can think about or talk about next. You can also

77
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,440
use chatbots to take actions beyond just outputting text. An AI-enabled feature that is very related

78
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,940
to today's chatbots is a personal assistant. You can use a personal assistant on your phone

79
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,060
to set a calendar event or send a text message to a friend. And a lot of chatbots now are also

80
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,780
able to connect to other software so that they can, for instance, search the internet to help

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,600
them answer your question. Here's an example of taking action by using a personal assistant.

82
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm using Google Assistant on an Android phone, and you could do something similar with Siri on an iPhone.

83
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,920
So first I ask it to create a calendar event.

84
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,760
It asks me some follow-ups on what is the event title and what is the time and date of the event.

85
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,440
And you can see that it added this event to my calendar.

86
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,660
Here's another example of taking action where a chatbot searches the internet in order to answer my question.

87
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:55,460
So I'm asking it about upcoming meteor showers, which is an example of a current or future event that will likely require the chatbot to find this information on the internet.

88
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,620
Also, a really helpful feature in this case is that it also outputs links to the websites that it searched so that you can read the original source content yourself.

89
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:14,040
And fairly recently, chatbots have also been designed so that they can take in not only text, but also take in images and text together as a combined input.

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,680
For example, you might take a picture of something and ask, what is this?

91
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,580
So here's an image, and I'll ask, is this a panda?

92
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,160
So the chatbot understands that my question is about the image that I'm also providing as part of the input.

93
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,640
And it explains that this is in fact not a panda, but a steamed bun or dumpling that looks like a panda.

94
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,780
Before you dive into the specific categories of tasks,

95
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,560
The next couple of videos will help you explore interesting characteristics of chatbots,

96
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,800
including how they behave and sometimes how they don't behave.

97
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,520
Next up is predicting the next word. I'll see you in the next video.
