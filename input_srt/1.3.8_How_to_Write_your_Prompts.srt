00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,760
If you learn how to write a love letter to your significant other really well, this will make life really great.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,020
If you learn how to write a prompt to a chatbot really well, then life will be pretty nice too.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,620
Let's take a look at some tips on how to write your prompts.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,740
The first thing you might find helpful is that you can prompt in the language of your choice.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,420
It doesn't have to be in English.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,960
For example, you can ask in Chinese, what's the difference between a Shih Tzu and a Havanese dog?

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,400
四肢圈和 Havanachuan有什么区别?

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,880
You can ask in French, what's the difference between a Shih Tzu and a Havanese dog?

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,120
quelle est la différence entre un Shih Tzu et un Sean Havanais?

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
Certain models have more training emphasis on certain languages.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,860
Mistral AI, for instance, is based in France,

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,160
and they focus their model training to make it perform well in several European languages,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,380
including French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,680
Another general tip I would recommend is to write more text than you normally would

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,760
compared to when you're doing a web search.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
A lot of us have been transitioning from doing web searches

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,820
to doing searches and requesting information from chatbots.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,900
So for instance, you might initially have a prompt like this.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,560
What is the difference between a Shih Tzu and a Havanese dog?

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,220
Let's see what you get from this prompt.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,440
So it answers the question and is fairly concise.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,800
But you can think about what you're looking for in the answer.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,640
Maybe ask it some intermediate steps that might help it to give a more complete answer,

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,500
such as list out similarities and differences.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,880
And perhaps you can share what you plan to do with the information you get.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,760
For example, ask it for advice on how to distinguish one thing from another.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,640
Let's see what you might get with a more detailed prompt.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,160
So you can see that it follows the guidance of the more detailed prompt

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,700
and lists similarities and differences,

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,780
then explains how to tell them apart.

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,060
So if you can be more detailed in what you're asking for,

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,500
then the chatbot will better understand what you're looking for and try to respond accordingly.

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Another general suggestion is to break down your task into a sequence of subtasks.

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,760
For instance, you can ask what's the difference between these two types of dogs

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,280
and give it a list of steps that you might have taken to answer this question yourself.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,760
First, review reference material, then list out similarities and differences,

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,700
And finally, suggest how to tell them apart.

38
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,680
And let's see what you might get.

39
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,840
And you can see at the top, it says, searched two sites,

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,860
meaning that it took those two web links that were provided

41
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,720
and looked through those in order for it to answer the question.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,660
And notice that there is a logical sequence to the subtasks.

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,800
The earlier tasks involve research and gathering information.

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,040
Those come before the later tasks that involve using that information to draw conclusions.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,840
And you can also describe how you want the output to be organized or formatted,

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,760
whether it's a table or bullet points or numbered list.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,440
For example, you can ask, format your response in a table with these rows and these columns,

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,000
and answer this part of the question with a list of bullet points.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,079
So this is quite helpful because by default, you'll most likely get either paragraphs

50
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,560
or sometimes bullet points, but if you want something different, then you can just ask for

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,740
that. Let's see what you might get with a prompt like this. So Gemini produces a nice looking table,

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,740
and on top of that, you may notice that it gives you an option to export into Google Sheets. Then

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,400
it provides a list of bullet points as requested. In addition to the format of the output, you can

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,580
also set expectations for what you consider to be a good response or good outcome. Most chatbots,

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,440
default tend to reply in a somewhat confident tone and will try their best to give some answer,

56
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,700
but you can set expectations that you would rather it admit when it's not sure or does not have enough

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,380
information. In other words, what you consider to be a good answer is sometimes to say "I don't know."

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,720
Let's first see what happens when you don't set the expectation and see how it differs when you do

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,680
set the expectation. So I'll just give it that top half of the prompt and not the bottom half.

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,600
Here's what you might get if you ask it to describe similarities and differences for the following categories.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,480
You might be thinking that the question about smell and taste is not as common as the category about appearance,

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,960
and that there's probably less information about how dogs smell or what kind of food they prefer over others.

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,260
But a chatbot may still try its best to give a reasonable answer.

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,580
Now let's see how the same chatbot will respond if you do include your expectation that when it's not sure, it should say so.

65
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,380
So you can see that in the case of taste, it does admit that it's not 100% sure about

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,280
specific differences.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,340
Another recommendation is to add structure to your prompts.

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,820
For instance, you can add subheaders to your prompts such as references and steps.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,460
You can include numbering and bullet points as well.

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,780
You can also use special characters around text that you think should be treated differently

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,220
than its surrounding text.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,520
For example, you may want to make it clear when a web link starts and ends, and so you

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
can put angle brackets around them.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,600
And you can choose any special characters to do this.

75
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,960
A common recommendation is to use three double quotes at the start and end, or use three

76
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,100
hashtags at the start and the end.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,320
These special characters that define the start and end of some specific piece of text are

78
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,420
called delimiters.

79
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,360
Let's try out this prompt.

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,300
And here, for instance, Cohere's chatbot interface lets you choose tools like Web Scraper, which

81
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,700
allows the chatbot to look up web pages that you give it links to.

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,500
Don't worry about the other tools right now, you'll learn more about tools later in the

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,340
So I'll go ahead and put in the prompt.

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,580
Notice how it indicates that it's using the URL scraper twice, one for each web link that's

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,280
given in the prompt.

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,500
One nice feature in Cohere's web interface is that you can highlight different parts

87
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,660
of its output, and it can give you the reference to the article where it got the information.

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,560
and it can help you verify that the output is grounded in the references that you asked it to

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,960
read. Another interesting feature of chatbots is that you can give them a temporary role or persona

90
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,500
that affects how they perform the task. You can say, you are a veterinarian, and then ask this

91
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,959
question. Or you can say, you are a comedian, and ask the same question. Let's go ahead and use a

92
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:33,700
model called Nemo by the company NVIDIA. So let's see if we can find Nemo. So here's Mistral AI's

93
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,160
website. Mistral AI actually teamed up with NVIDIA to train a model called Mistral Nemo, which is

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,220
based on NVIDIA's large language model Nemo. If I click on the current model, which is called

95
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,319
Mistral Large 2, it shows the models available. And look, I found Mistral Nemo here. So I'll first

96
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,960
give it a persona of a veterinarian, and let's see what it says. It gives a fairly structured answer

97
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,240
with different subheaders that includes its health and lifespan. Now let's try again by giving it the

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,100
persona of a comedian who likes to tell jokes. Now, with the persona of a comedian, instead of a

99
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,180
structured and formal answer, it gives a short paragraph that sounds more casual. Now, I'll admit

100
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,759
that I was hoping that it would tell a joke based on the prompt, what's the difference between a

101
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,400
shih tzu and a Havanese dog. If giving a persona isn't enough, you can give it explicit instructions

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,640
to tell a joke. And you can also try something else. You can give it examples of prompts and

103
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,680
completions to show it how you want to perform a task. So I give it a question, what's the

104
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,640
difference between a guitar and a fish? And I also give it the answer, which is a joke, you can't

105
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,279
tune a fish. And then I give it another example of the question, what's the difference between a

106
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,640
well-dressed dog on a bicycle and a poorly dressed dog on a unicycle. And I also give it an answer,

107
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,320
which is a tire. And finally, I give it the question that I want it to answer, which is,

108
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,760
what is the difference between a Shih Tzu and a Havanese dog? This pattern of giving examples

109
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,700
of both the input and the desired output in a prompt is what researchers are calling

110
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,220
few-shot prompting. In contrast, if you don't give any examples and just give it a task,

111
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,960
This is called zero shot prompting.

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,300
Now, the classic way of doing few shot prompting is to give the examples and then the next question.

113
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,880
But in practice, you may find it more helpful to give a bit more instruction for what you're asking the chatbot to do.

114
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,539
So I'm also going to start this prompt with this instruction.

115
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,840
Study how these questions are answered.

116
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,260
And I'm also going to proceed the final question with the instruction.

117
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,580
Now answer the following question.

118
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,120
Let's try this out using Meta AI.

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,400
Okay, so it's okay, some answers are funnier than others,

120
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,080
but you can see that it's attempting to answer the question as if giving the punchline to a joke,

121
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,220
in a similar structure as the previous examples given in the prompt.

122
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,120
Maybe you can play around with your own prompt and see if you can get the model to tell some good jokes.

123
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,299
The next optional video will take a break from AI and discuss some interpretations of the expression

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,240
every cloud has a silver lining. After that, the next several videos will dive into the different

125
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,500
categories of tasks that you saw in the overview. See you in the next video, or the one after that.
