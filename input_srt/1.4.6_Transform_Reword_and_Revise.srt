00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,640
In addition to transforming your text from one language to another, you can also transform it

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,180
by rewording it or revising it. Let's take a look at how you can use chatbots to do that.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,280
Let's say you recently became friends with a captain of a ship because he very generously gave

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,519
you a ride home on a ship when you were in Puerto Rico. Your friend arrived here recently after

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,620
sailing through a hurricane around Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. He recently bought a compass in

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,260
Miami, Florida, and he wants to ask customer service if he can return it. So he's written a letter to

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,080
customer service asking for a replacement, and he's asking you to help reword his email to make sure

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,960
it's understood. Well, you can use a chatbot to help you reword your friend's email. Here are some

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,979
instructions to revise the following text to American-style English and to choose accessible

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,620
vocabulary words. To increase the chance that customer service is willing to help out, you ask

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:03,660
a chatbot to adjust the tone to keep it positive and avoid any misunderstanding. You also ask it to

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,600
try its best to maintain the original intent of the text. So let's try it out.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,380
So it looks like the chatbot maintains the original intent by pointing out that the compass

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,299
isn't functioning and that your friend feels disappointed and even mentions trying to fix it

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,040
by giving it a friendly gesture. And the chatbot still says that your friend is hoping for a prompt

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,320
resolution and it signs the name Francis K.O. Ko. So it looks like it's doing a decent job of

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,320
rewording it while maintaining the original intent. And this can be helpful to you as well if you're

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,600
traveling abroad and learning another language, maybe even trying to work in another language.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,499
You can ask a chatbot to help you reword your letters or emails or any writing that you do in

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,380
language that you're still learning. And even if you're writing in a language of your choice,

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
you might find it helpful to use speech recognition, also called voice dictation,

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,140
to help you with your writing. What you'll find when you're using speech recognition

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,280
is that the final wording might need a little bit of cleanup. This is in part because when you speak,

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,140
you're also thinking through the words you want to use. Maybe you'll also use some filler words

25
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,559
or repeat some phrase to try to clarify what you wanted to say. So let's look at an example and see

26
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,660
how you can ask a chatbot to help you clean up the transcription for you.

27
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,620
So, you know, I explained to all the people that, you know, that were there about how,

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:36,020
you know, I guess sausages are made. And so, well, well, that was the last time they invited

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:44,039
me back to the hot dog eating contest. Let's see how you can ask a chatbot to help clean up this

30
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,920
transcription. Let's first point out that the text that you want to work on was produced from speech

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,340
recognition, and you can ask the chatbot to rewrite it to correct the spelling or wording that may be

32
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,560
due to converting speech to text. For example, there may be words that sound the same but are

33
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,300
spelled differently and have different meanings, which you might recall from earlier in the course.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
There are also filler words that we naturally may say when we're speaking aloud or thinking aloud,

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,019
but maybe we want to remove those in the final transcript. And this next part I think is quite

36
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,600
helpful because sometimes when a chatbot revises my writing, it may do more than I actually wanted

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,780
to do. So I want to set expectations that what I'm looking for is to preserve as much as possible

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,140
the style and tone and word choice. Again, this goes back to a general prompting tip of setting

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,080
expectations for what you consider to be a good output or a good outcome. So let's see how it does.

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:46,080
It gives the revision as well as some explanations for what it changed, and I like that it seems to be keeping most of the word choice that I originally had.

41
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,900
It also explains when it's removing filler words and phrases that are unclear or not grammatically correct.

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,020
You can also ask a chatbot to help you rewrite a prompt.

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,420
For example, maybe you want to translate Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining into other languages.

44
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:09,280
You can first ask the chatbot to rewrite the prompt to make the instructions clear and to get more complete or thorough results.

45
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,640
Let's see what we get from that.

46
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,000
So it's pretty good.

47
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,640
First, it puts quotes around the phrase, every cloud has a silver lining.

48
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,680
It also specifies specific languages, but it also asks in the prompt to not limit the answer to just those languages.

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,560
It also asks the chatbot to ensure that the translations convey the same meaning as the original phrase,

50
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,400
So this is getting into whether it would be a figurative idiomatic type of translation

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,880
or a literal word-for-word translation.

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,020
So it's pretty cool.

53
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,920
Looks like even if you forget most of the tips and tricks that you learned in this course,

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,900
you can still remember to ask a chatbot to help you reword and rewrite your prompts.

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,120
But I hope you still found all the advice on prompting helpful, and I hope you also had

56
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,000
fun while learning it.

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,700
Coming up next, you'll practice asking a chatbot to help you with fact-checking.

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,620
Let's look at that in the next video.
