Thank you for writing with the Metropolitan Time Travel Authority.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,940
The next stop is one week into the future.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,740
Congratulations on finishing this course.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,980
Now you know how AI is used to blur the background of this photo.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,580
You're now also aware of why a phrase like this can be translated to this, a cake.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,460
whereas that same phrase might also be translated into this, a game for children.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,960
You can now also explain why asking a chatbot to solve a problem with this wording may lead to an incorrect answer,

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,280
whereas making this small change to the last sentence like this may lead to the correct answer.

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,860
You're now familiar with how to use chatbots to perform a wide range of tasks,

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,580
And you practiced with all of these chatbots, including ones that you can download onto your

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,940
personal computer. You've practiced for a job interview by instructing a chatbot to play the

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,160
role of the interviewer. And you've guided two chatbots to collaborate with each other,

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,320
one to play the role of a writer and the other to play the role of an editor as the two discuss

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,700
and iterate to write an article. And you also know how AI can help you answer one of life's

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,440
age-old questions. Can I park here? You finished with an open-ended mini project where you combined

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,700
the various AI tools to perform some daily tasks and made a short video to document your project.

17
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,620
Well, at least that's a taste of what you'll be able to do once you complete this course.

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,520
Let's go back to the beginning.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,740
Thank you for writing with the Metropolitan Time Travel Authority. The next stop is the present.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,579
Hi, welcome back. You're about to get an overview of artificial intelligence

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,840
and machine learning. Then look at personal use cases for computer vision, machine translation,

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,840
and then get an in-depth look at chatbots, how they behave, and how you can make the most of using

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,620
them. There's more than one way to go through this course, depending on how much time you have.

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,860
If you want to get a quick overview, you can just watch all the videos. You can always come back and

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,480
do some of the optional hands-on practice later. When you do have time to get more hands-on practice,

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,300
Then after each video, you'll see text that reviews some key points from the video and also provides some optional practice that you can try out.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,460
The hands-on practice will really help you explore and maybe even discover something new by yourself.

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:41,360
So before we get started, I'd like you to warm up a bit by taking your hand out and now wiggle your fingers, raise your arm up and bend your elbow and pat yourself on the back to congratulate yourself for starting this journey in AI.

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,140
Your future self will thank you.

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,480
That was great.

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,500
Really good take.

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:46,880
Let's go.

33
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,640
Thank you.
