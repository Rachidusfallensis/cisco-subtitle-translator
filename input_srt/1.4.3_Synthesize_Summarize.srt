1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,420
Have you ever had to read through a really long document and summarize the key points?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,860
Well, now you can ask a chatbot to do that for you.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,580
Now let's take a look at one of these synthesized tasks called summarization.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,160
Text summarization can really help you speed up your learning or help you when you're researching

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,520
a topic to really extract the parts of an article or document that's most relevant to what you're

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:25,940
looking for.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,200
So let's look at an example where you might use summarization.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,580
Let's say you want to learn about Banksy from a Wikipedia article.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
It's quite long, and you may want to focus on a specific subtopic within the article.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,740
So how can you ask a chatbot to help?

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
One thing you can try is to give the chatbot a web link and then ask it to summarize the article.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,080
And in this case, I'm going to have it focus on a specific subtopic,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,160
which is to summarize Banksy's activities that relate to social, geopolitical, or current events.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,560
Let's use Notebook LM by Google, which is a tool that lets you upload documents and then chat about them using Gemini.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
You can start by clicking the button "Create" and you can see there are a couple options for uploading documents.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,300
You can connect it to Google Drive, you can paste the text in directly, you can upload documents in PDF or text format,

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,920
and it also has the option for you to provide a link to a website. Let's use the website option.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Again, here's the Wikipedia article, so you can copy the web link and paste it in here.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm fast forwarding a bit, but it takes a few seconds to process the website.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,060
Now you can see on the left that it has uploaded this web article as a source

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,980
that the chatbot will use when you prompt it for something.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,960
And here's the prompt: Summarize Banksy's activities that relate to social, geopolitical,

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,820
or current events. Let's zoom in a bit. You can see that it's a fairly detailed and also

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,200
annotated list of topics. You can double check that these are coming from the source material.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,700
It mentions an elephant that was painted pink.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,640
If you go back to the web article, you can verify that it's mentioned there.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,980
You can also click on the citation buttons within the output,

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,080
and it opens up a side window that also shows the original text from the Wikipedia article.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
Let's do another check.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,880
It mentions a piece of art called Love is in the Bin.

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,140
Here, if you click on the first citation, it doesn't seem to mention this piece of art.

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,660
But for the next citation, it does mention this particular piece of artwork.

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,540
And if you go to the original article, you can see it there too.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,240
So I hope you can see that having a chatbot read through an article first

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,720
can really help you zoom in and focus on the topics or details that you're really interested in.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,800
And I hope you can also see how valuable it is to be able to reference the original source material.

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,500
And I'll just mention that Balloon Girl is one of Banksy's most famous pieces of art,

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,600
and it was transformed into another piece of art called Love is in the Bin.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,120
If you're curious to learn more, you can check out the Wikipedia article or ask a chatbot.

40
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,120
You may find that if you use the keyword summarize for a task,

41
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,120
then a chatbot may reply in its own words instead of providing direct quotes from the original source material.

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,020
And since not all chatbots have the feature of linking citations to the original source,

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,740
it may become a bit more difficult to verify if the chatbot's output is coming from the source document.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,720
so you may prefer that it gives you word-for-word text from the source instead.

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,200
One recommendation I have is, instead of saying summarize,

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,020
you may want to ask it to extract relevant text as direct quotes.

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,320
This encourages the chatbot to use the exact wording from the source material.

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,960
One thing I've experienced is that sometimes it's not enough to only say extract relevant text.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Sometimes it works better if you use this entire phrase, extract relevant text as direct quotes.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,860
to try to make it clear as possible that you want it to not try to summarize in its own words,

51
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,160
but to really get the original wording from the source.

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,280
Let's try this out with ChatGPT.

53
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,640
And it looks like it has provided some direct quotes, but let's double check.

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,860
So as before, you can copy some text and then search for it in the original source.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,300
Here you can see the issue is just that the elephant in the room was in double quotes in the original article,

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,140
and it was changed to single quotes in the output of the chatbot,

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,500
but the rest of the text was retrieved word for word.

58
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,920
Let's check another example.

59
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,240
Here's another piece of text, nine images on the Israeli West Bank wall,

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,420
and we can see that it's extracted that text word for word.

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,620
One thing I would like to note is that if I run this multiple times,

62
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,020
sometimes ChatGPT will say,

63
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,280
sorry, I actually can't do that.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
Please go to the website yourself and extract the relevant text.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,040
So sometimes when you ask it to extract direct quotes,

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,020
it might decline to do so. For other chatbots that I've tried, a lot of them are only allowed

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,420
to summarize, but are not allowed to extract direct quotes. And most of the chatbots that

68
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,340
you've seen in the previous videos do not have the ability to work with a web link.

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,340
Sometimes they will reply as if they're complying with your instruction, but when you double check,

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,900
you'll notice that it's just producing information based on its own knowledge and not retrieving it

71
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,959
from the article. So if providing a direct web link to a website isn't working, then one thing

72
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,320
you can try is to download that web page as an HTML file and upload the file to

73
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,120
the chatbot. So then the prompt will become: "From the following attached

74
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,760
document, extract all the relevant text and the rest of the prompt is the same."

75
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,920
For ChatGPT, there's this paperclip icon and it allows you to upload from your

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,000
computer. So let's first go back to the Wikipedia article and download it as a

77
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,820
file and then let's save the web page as HTML only.

78
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,460
Now that you have a file, you can upload it and then give your instructions.

79
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,880
And you can see that it has these hyperlinks in green that refer to the attached file.

80
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,800
It's saying, "These are quotes that were extracted directly from the attached document."

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,580
And it's always good to double-check, so you can copy some text from this output

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,120
and then check if it's actually in the original article.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,540
For Claude, you can see that you can upload five files with a limit of 30 megabytes each.

84
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,880
So I can upload this HTML file to see if it works.

85
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,200
works. And here it says that it's over the length limit. So all of these chatbots have

86
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,420
different context lengths. That's how much text it can take in at one single time as

87
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,980
a prompt. Let's try this with Command + R + by Coher. We'll upload that same HTML file.

88
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,420
OK, so far, no error, so I'll go ahead and give it the instructions. So this is taking

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,700
a bit of time, so I'm speeding up the video recording a bit. One of the reasons this takes

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,940
quite a long time is because the HTML file has a lot of other structure around the text.

91
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,640
Later, you'll see a way to make this a bit more efficient for the chatbot by just giving

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,800
it the exact text and nothing else.

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,780
But you can see that if you were to open up the HTML file, there's a lot of structure

94
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,560
around the text that gives it the font and also the layout.

95
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,060
If you were to look at this from a text document, it would sort of look like code.

96
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,920
So coming back, looks like it was able to process this document.

97
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,320
And what's really cool is that chatbots can understand that when you ask for social, political,

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,260
cultural, or current events, you can see topics about poverty or environment and understand

99
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,760
that these words are also related to what you're asking for. In comparison, if you were to use

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,860
traditional software, you would probably have to specify keywords that you were looking for

101
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,040
that refer to these social, political, or current events,

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,100
such as specific names of countries

103
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,100
and specific keywords like climate or war or refugee.

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,520
And it's still really helpful to be ready

105
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,300
to copy and paste the source text directly into the prompt.

106
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,860
This is because some chatbots don't take in HTML files.

107
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,780
Some chatbots also don't take in any attached documents at all,

108
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
but they can still perform the task quite well

109
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,860
if you give them the source document

110
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
as plain text inside the prompt.

111
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,820
So I recommend first saving that text into some word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word,

112
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,540
and also first checking how much text the chatbot can actually take in as an input at one time.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,540
Let's check if the other chatbots let you upload documents.

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,240
In Mistral, there's currently no upload file feature at the time that I'm filming this lecture.

115
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,960
In Gemini, you can only upload an image. We'll get into images later in the course.

116
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,160
In Meta AI, you can't currently upload anything at this time.

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,300
And in Microsoft Copilot, you can only upload an image.

118
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,159
So for these chatbots, you can still copy and paste the text directly into the prompt.

119
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,919
To make it easier, let's first copy this text into a word processor.

120
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,599
So you can open up a blank Google Doc, for instance,

121
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,460
use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-A on a PC or Command-A on a Mac,

122
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,800
copy all the text, and paste it into the word processor.

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,440
Let's do a little bit of cleanup.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
Usually at the bottom of these Wikipedia articles, there are citations and external links.

125
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,140
We probably won't need these for this task, so I'm just going to make it a bit shorter

126
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,580
by removing all the references.

127
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,000
And I'll also do a little bit of cleanup at the top.

128
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,340
Now you can double check if you can actually paste all the text directly into these chatbots,

129
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,900
because they do have a limit to how much text they can take in for the prompt.

130
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,500
And again, this is called the context length.

131
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
So let's see how much text can fit into each of these chatbots as a single prompt.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,680
Recall that prompting tip test it before you rely on it.

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,640
So you can check what was the last piece of text that still appears inside the prompt window after you try to paste in the entire text.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,440
For Mistral, it looks like it was able to take in the entire text that I copied from the doc.

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,520
With Gemini, it looks like it stopped somewhere earlier, and I can check by copying some of the text and seeing where in the document that is.

136
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,160
So at about page 26, it stopped pasting in the text.

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,200
So with Gemini, it was able to take in about 26 pages worth of the text.

138
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,340
With Mistral, the whole thing was about 51 pages.

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,180
Now let's check the context length for Meta AI.

140
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,480
Looks like it was about 14 pages.

141
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
Now let's try Microsoft Copilot.

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,620
It says maximum character limit reached, and I can see where that ended in the document.

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,840
And in this case, it was about 4 pages.

144
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,120
Now let's prepare to put the entire text about Banksy into the prompt.

145
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:22,380
And then after that, I'm going to say, for the provided text above, extract all the relevant text as direct quotes, so it's the same request as before.

146
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,220
Notice that I'm putting a delimiter here to separate the article text from the instructions.

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,820
These characters are called backticks, but you could also use three hashtags or three double quotes or three single quotes.

148
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,960
And if you want to use three of any other characters, it'll probably work okay as well.

149
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,020
Let's try this with Mistral, since I was able to fit the entire source text into the context window.

150
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,920
Let's also try this with Claude. Recall that when I uploaded the HTML file directly to Claude,

151
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,800
it said that it was over the context length window. Now, I'm just copy-pasting that text

152
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,140
from the word processor. It saves that text as an attachment, and it looks like it can take in that

153
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,200
entire 52 pages of text. So this is good to keep in mind, that if you upload an HTML file, the extra

154
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,599
formatting also takes up space in the context window. If you want to make the most of the context

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,780

Another way to synthesize information is to give it labels, such as topics or positive or negative sentiment, and more.

161
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,840
This is helpful when you have a lot of separate pieces of text that you want to make sense of.
