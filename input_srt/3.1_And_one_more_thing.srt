00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,580
Pretty cool, huh? Welcome to the future. You've now completed this course. There's just one

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,760
more thing I'd like you to do. Take both hands out like this, wiggle your fingers, and give

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,040
Give yourself a round of applause for completing this segment of your AI journey.

4
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,220
I hope you enjoyed the ride.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,520
Bye now!

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,440
I actually didn't know how to end this.

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,120
And then maybe one with my hands out.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,780
Congra...

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,700
Sorry.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,100
Okay.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,760
And then you'll probably need to cut me because I don't remember this.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,320
And then pat yourself on the back and congratulate yourself.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,800
Oh, I should have looked at that camera.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,740
to congratulate yourself. Sorry. What if you computed... Oh, is someone gonna throw the ball

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,300
to me? Or am I gonna toss you one? Oh yes, could you toss me one? So instead of playing catch to

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,700
yourself, I'm just gonna toss it to you? Yeah, yeah. Does this require intelligence? Sorry.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:25,500
Some tasks are harder. So should I pick it up sooner maybe? Is this a cake? Cheesecake. That

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,120
Sorry.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
It just smells so good.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,660
Let's take a closer look.

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,680
Oh, it smells so good.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,400
Sorry.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,280
Object detection.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,120
Sorry.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,000
I hope my brain is...

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,520
Okay.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,440
Sorry, I moved.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,960
It's up here.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry.

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,340
I let the cat out of the bag.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,520
Sorry.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,240
I let the cat out of the bag.

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,840
It didn't.

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Okay, yay, salad.

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,660
Okay, if you baked a cake, okay.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,960
You may have at one point tried to discoo-

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,039
Oh my gosh, that was a bad thing, okay.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
- Yeah, that's good.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,260
- Welcome to the future.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,900
You've now owned.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,600
- No worries.

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,080
- Like, yeah, look that way.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,700
Oh, this is crazy.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,260
I think we're going to need to take like four or five more takes of this.

45
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,520
Okay, thanks.

46
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,240
All right.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:38,860
Got it.

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,300
Mm-hmm.
