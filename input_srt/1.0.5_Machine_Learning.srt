1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,380
If you want to learn how to bake a cake, how would you do that?

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,320
One way to learn is to get a cookbook and follow the instructions step by step.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,620
Another way to do that is to watch a friend, family member, or someone on YouTube do it,

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,840
and then you can follow along and try to mimic what they're doing.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
Let's see how this relates to AI, and in particular a subfield of AI called machine learning.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,800
So going back to a little bit of history, AI researchers from the 1950s to 1980s primarily

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,480
worked on a subfield of AI called symbolic AI in which they came up with ever more complex

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,800
instructions to get machines to perform tasks intelligently. This is often referred to as a

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,740
rules-based approach. However, at the same time, there was another approach called machine learning

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,960
based on statistics, and it tried to get a computer to learn from data and examples instead of giving

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,420
it lots of rules to follow. The term of machine learning was first coined by Arthur Samuel,

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,960
a researcher at IBM, who trained a computer to play the game of checkers, not by giving it lots

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,479
of instructions on how to play the game, but by getting the computer to play checkers against a

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,820
version of itself and to learn over time what moves gave it more points or fewer points. Tom

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,160
Mitchell, a professor who founded Carnegie Mellon's machine learning department, gave a formal

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,560
definition of machine learning that's been widely cited. I'll first give one of his quotes from his

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,960
book, then the more formal and famous one. Machine learning is the study of algorithms that allows

18
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,340
computer programs to automatically improve through experience. And here's the original definition

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,360
from Tom Mitchell. I removed some words because I think it helps to see the simpler wording first.

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,960
A computer program is said to learn from experience with respect to some tasks if its performance

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,580
at the tasks as measured improves with experience. And now here's the full text. A program is said to

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,060
learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,960
performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. In other words,

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,200
a machine learns from experience if it performs a task, gets objective feedback on how well it does,

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,900
and then uses that feedback to get better at that task. Let's walk through an example of the

26
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,239
machine learning approach. Suppose you want a machine to perform a task of identifying whether

27
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,300
a photograph is of a panda or not a panda. You give the machine an image and ask it to output

28
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,900
panda or not panda. So far, it knows nothing about what pandas look like, but it performs the task

29
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,420
as best it can and in this case outputs not a panda. Then you give it the correct answer, panda.

30
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,680
The machine takes note that its prediction was incorrect and makes some adjustments.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,700
Then you give it another image like this one. It tries its best and in this case outputs panda.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,720
You give it the correct answer, which is also panda.

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,420
Again, the machine uses your feedback, compares it to what it output itself, and makes adjustments,

34
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,100
or essentially learns, so that it can do better the next time it performs the task.

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,340
So the next time it does this task again, whether on the same image or on new images that it's never seen before,

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,620
it gets better at predicting whether the image is of a panda or not.

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,500
And you do this in a loop, with many images, probably between 100 and 1000.

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,820
For each image, you provide the correct answer to the machine only after it has attempted

39
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,260
to do the task itself.

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,180
It predicts "not panda" and it gets the feedback that it's correct.

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,340
Here it predicts that this is a panda and it gets feedback that it's actually not a panda.

42
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,280
It predicts that this is a panda and it gets feedback that this is actually not a panda.

43
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
to get better at performing this task.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,120
And one more thing, you can actually try this yourself

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,240
with something called Teachable Machine

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,900
offered by Google on this free website.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,739
Let's take a look at how to use it.

48
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,900
If you go here, just click on Get Started,

49
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,860
click on Image Project on the left,

50
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
and then for this pop-up, just choose the one on the left,

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
Standard Image Model.

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,020
And here you can see that it lets you take pictures

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,440
of one class of objects and a second class of objects.

54
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,520
I'm going to use Pandas for the first class

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,420
and dogs for the second.

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
So let me just change the label to Panda on the top

57
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,240
and Dog on the bottom.

58
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,060
And then for the Panda, I'm going to click on Webcam.

59
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,600
And you can see that now my webcam is on.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,140
I'm going to take some pictures of this Panda.

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,700
So I'll hold the record, and I'll get some different angles.

62
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,600
And then now I'll do the same for the dog.

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,240
So I'll click Hold to record, get some different angles,

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,100
and then now I can train the model.

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,240
So I'll click Train Model.

66
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,480
Great.

67
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,440
Now you can see that I can test this model to see how it does.

68
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,480
So now I'll give it an object that it hasn't seen before,

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
and it will try to figure out whether it's a panda or a dog.

70
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,100
Cool. And you can see that it has probabilities, but there's a higher probability that it's a panda.

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's try this one. Here you can see it thinks it's a dog. Now I'll just try one more thing.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,340
I guess it thinks I'm a dog.

73
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,340
So it's really fun, and I encourage you to try it yourself with your own objects.

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,780
So how does the machine learn?

75
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,120
It's using something called a model.

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,820
Let's learn more about models in the next video.
