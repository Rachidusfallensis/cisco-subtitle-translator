1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,080
You've seen how you as a person can chat with a chatbot.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,480
Now let's see how you can have two chatbots chat with each other in order to collaborate on a task.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:21,300
So far in the course, you've seen how you can collaborate with a chatbot where you give it guidance and feedback and ask it to iterate on some task.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,720
But what if instead you ask another chatbot to play that role of giving guidance and feedback?

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,400
And you're still in the discussion more as an intermediary overseeing both of them.

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,100
Let's take an example where one of the chatbots is a writer for a news publication,

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,540
and the other chatbot is an editor who reviews the work of the writer and gives feedback and suggestions.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,880
Here's the prompt for the writer to write their first draft.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,380
You can start by giving the role.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,980
So the writer chatbot is a professional magazine writer for the Daily Bugle.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,780
They take an edgy, humorous approach to sharing serious matters to their readers.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,060
And here is the task.

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,820
Write a short opinion piece to argue that superheroes should clean up after themselves

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,980
after saving the city, such as cleaning up spider webs.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,800
Sign the essay with the title, Your Friendly Neighborhood Writer.

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,340
I'll go ahead and ask Coheres, Command R+, to play the role of the writer and give it

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,320
the role in his task.

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,380
And here's the output.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,460
Don't worry, I'll scroll back up so that we can go through this together.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,640
The article starts out with some praise for superheroes and then points out that they

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,360
need to start cleaning up after their battles.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,960
It brings up cleanup costs and that taxpayers have to pay for them.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
It does acknowledge the efforts of superheroes in saving the city,

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,780
but also points out that they could do a quick sweep and make the city look nice again.

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,520
And as instructed in the prompt, the writer chatbot signs the article,

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Friendly Neighborhood Writer.

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,380
So overall, I think it does follow the role of trying to make this a humorous approach

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,140
to addressing a serious topic.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,460
So a second chatbot will now play the role of the editor.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,500
I'll start the prompt with the role and then follow up with the task for the first review of the essay.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,180
So you're going to tell the second chatbot that they're an editor for a news organization, The Daily Bugle.

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,280
The editor ensures that articles are getting their facts right and citing sources.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,380
The editor also encourages citing numbers and aggregate information to back up anecdotal evidence.

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,780
But they allow the journalist to maintain their writing style and artistic vision.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
And here's the task.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,600
Given an essay, give feedback on what is good and what can be improved.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,280
Suggest additional examples that might fit in with the existing content.

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,780
Suggest phrases or wording that could make the essay more engaging.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,020
Also, do not rewrite the essay.

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,680
And I mention this because sometimes when I've tried this, the editor chatbot will not only give feedback, but will then try to rewrite the entire essay.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,140
But that role is for the writer chatbot.

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,900
Finally, we'll provide the essay at the bottom.

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,760
To play the role of the editor, I will use Mistral-Large2 by Mistral AI.

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,000
So I'll give it the prompt, then I'll go back to Command R plus and copy the essay.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,000
And here's the output.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,320
I'll scroll back up to the top once it's done.

47
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay, so it looks like the editor breaks things down by what it likes and things that can be improved.

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,460
It likes the conversational tone and use of specific examples in arguing for superhero accountability.

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,620
For areas of improvement, the editor asks for facts and numbers,

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,720
for example, estimates of property damage caused by superhero battles.

51
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,880
Recall that it's probably taking a note from the role description in the prompt

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,040
where we ask the editor to have a preference for specific numbers and for citing sources.

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
The editor recommends some additional examples, which it will suggest below.

54
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,680
It also suggests providing a counter-argument or rebuttal to add to this essay.

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,700
And this is kind of interesting because psychologists have studied

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,840
what types of articles can be persuasive enough to convince someone to change their perspective.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,120
on some topic about science or politics.

58
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,060
They actually found that articles which try to fairly address all the other options and

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,640
opinions and also provide evidence that might go even against the main argument, those articles

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,780
that seem more balanced have a slightly better chance of persuading someone to consider the

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,820
main argument and actually change their minds.

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,900
And here are some additional examples that the editor suggests could be added.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,860
It mentions Iron Man's suit malfunctions, as well as Captain America's fights, and also

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,380
environmental impact of Thor's weather-related powers. The editor also suggests some specific

65
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,660
wording changes. Instead of, it's time for a little tough love, it recommends, it's time for a reality

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,380
check. Instead of, don't get me started on the cleanup costs, it recommends, let's not even broach

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,280
the topic of cleanup costs. It's enough to make a taxpayer's head spin. So some of these style

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,820
choices I wouldn't necessarily think are better than the original. They're not worse either, but it

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,720
helps for you as a human to stay in the loop to make that decision. The last suggestion is to say

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,920
we're not asking for the moon, just a little tidiness. So that's kind of a fun stylistic way

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,160
of saying we don't ask for much. The editor also recommends gathering interviews from eyewitnesses

72
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,040
or experts about the topic. Now let's bring this feedback back to the writer and now we'll ask the

73
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,080
writer to incorporate the feedback. Given the following feedback from the editor, consider what

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,120
feedback you, the writer, want to accept, but also consider what feedback that you as the writer will

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,100
reject and explain why. I think it's also important to give the writer some agency in deciding whether

76
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,200
they should accept or reject the feedback. Next, we can ask the writer to reflect on their essay

77
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,740
and share what they might want to change, and then finally they'll rewrite their essay. And below

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,600
these instructions, we'll go ahead and include the editor's feedback. So I'll give the writer this

79
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,800
prompt as well as copy and paste the feedback from the other chatbot. Okay, so scrolling back up,

80
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,300
Let's see what it says. The writer acknowledges the praise for their tone and use of specific

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,420
examples. It agrees that providing more factual data such as property damage estimates would be

82
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,440
helpful and acknowledges the additional examples. It also agrees about gathering insights from

83
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,100
eyewitnesses and experts. It's also rejecting some feedback, which I think is helpful because it's

84
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,200
not always the case that the editor is always right or that the writer is also always right.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,940
So it's helpful to allow both the writer and the editor to play some role in deciding what goes in

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and what goes out of this essay. In this case, the writer decides not to use a counter-argument or

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,540
rebuttal because it believes this may shift the tone and detract from the intended style,

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,520
which is a more light-hearted and humorous tone. I personally don't see how including counter-arguments

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,860
or differing points of view would prevent the essay from having a humorous light-hearted tone,

90
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,260
so this is still a reminder that you as the person, as the human, still play an important

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,580
role in deciding what makes sense here. And now the writer is rewriting its essay. Let's see if we can

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,700
spot how it has changed its writing based on the feedback. It's now using the phrase reality check,

93
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,460
which was one of these suggestions. It also includes the examples suggested about Iron Man,

94
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,880
Captain America, and Thor. It also used the suggested wording, we're not asking for the moon

95
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,960
here. It adds something new, which I think is kind of a nice touch. Those with extraordinary powers

96
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,580
also take on extraordinary responsibilities. If you're familiar with the Spider-Man comics or

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,520
movies, it's a rewording of a famous line from the Spider-Man comics, with great ability comes great

98
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,960
accountability, or something like that. Maybe you can ask the chatbot what that famous phrase is.

99
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,540
All right, let's do this one last time. I mean, I could do this all day. But let's wrap up with a

100
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,740
second review by the editor. Now you're going to ask the editor to review the second draft.

101
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,960
Discuss which of the editor's suggestions were actually incorporated in the writer's second

102
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,340
draft, and also which suggestions were not. Then think through whether the essay is ready for

103
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,300
publication, but also think through reasons why the essay should go through more revisions. Finally,

104
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,020
ask the editor to decide whether the essay is ready for publication or if it should go through

105
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,220
more revisions. So we'll give these instructions to do the second review, and here's the output.

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,419
Once it's done, we'll scroll back up and go through this. The editor notes about how some of their

107
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,260
suggestions about adding examples of Iron Man and Captain America were included. They also point

108
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,260
out that some of the phrasing was included, such as reality check and making a taxpayer's headspin.

109
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,200
It also found that its mention of the environmental impact was also included. The editor also notes

110
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
some things that were not included, such as more factual data or estimates of property damage,

111
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,800
or additional eyewitness or expert accounts. It notes that there was no counter-argument or

112
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,740
rebuttal, although they acknowledged that the writer made this conscious decision not to include that.

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,020
It lists out possible reasons for allowing the essay to be published as is, and then reasons why it may benefit from additional revisions.

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,419
Notice that it points out two areas where the writer did not add these suggestions, but also did not explicitly reject them.

115
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,700
In fact, the writer, if you recall, actually thought these were good suggestions.

116
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,360
For example, the writer did not, in the second draft, add additional statistics or eyewitness or expert accounts.

117
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,400
So it looks like the editor makes the decision that the article should go through another round of revision before publication.

118
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,940
At this point, I do want to point out your role as a human in all of this, because it

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,160
can kind of feel like you can just find some quick way of automating this so that the writer

120
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,880
and editor chatbots talk to each other directly, and you can just wait for them to give the

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,480
final results.

122
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
And there are tools that allow you to do that, but here's one example that I think makes

123
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,860
the case for why having you as a human in the loop is so valuable.

124
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,519
When the writer is incorporating feedback in its second draft, it likes the recommendation

125
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,820
given by the editor to gather insights from eyewitnesses or experts. So it says,

126
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:31,920
I will create fictional quotes or interviews to provide a unique and entertaining perspective.

127
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,180
Now for a human, this may ring alarm bells right away because a publication, any news organization,

128
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
should publish facts and not make things up. Let's check how the editor followed up during

129
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,020
this second review. It mentions that there are no insights from eyewitnesses or experts added,

130
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,240
which could have provided a unique and entertaining perspective. And while that's true, it would have

131
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,460
been even better if the editor realized the bigger issue, which is that the role of the news

132
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,780
organization is to provide facts and not to make things up. So having a human in the loop, having

133
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,280
you in the loop when working with AI, applies pretty much any time you're working with software

134
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:17,640
that helps you automate things. It's especially the case when the task requires an ability to handle ambiguity and to possibly think more broadly,

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,780
as is the case with using chatbots to perform these more open-ended tasks.

136
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:31,260
Coming up, chatbots can output text to perform lots of different tasks, but if you give them tools to use, they can take actions beyond just outputting text.

137
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,200
Let's look at taking action using tools next.
