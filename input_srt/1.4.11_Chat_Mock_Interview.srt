1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,100
When you have a conversation with a chatbot, you can actually prompt it to take the initiative and lead the conversation.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
For example, you could have it be an interviewer and help you do interview prep.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,240
Recently, you wrote a letter to the president of Furry Friends Forever Cat Cafe,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,420
asking them to consider you for a position at that cafe.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,140
And congratulations, they're giving you an interview.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,900
and the interviewer will probably ask you some questions, listen to your answers, and ask more

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,740
follow-up questions. Interviews can be a little bit intimidating, but it gets easier with practice.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,880
And practicing with your friends is great, but you could also practice with a chatbot. Let's see how

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,540
you can do that. You can start by defining the chatbot's role as an interviewer for a job

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,160
position. The position that you're applying for is cat cafe manager. So here's the job description.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,880
provide attention to cats, feed the cats, make coffee for guests, give cat petting guidelines

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,860
to guests, and clean the cats and litter boxes. And here's the task for the interviewer. The

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,580
interviewer will ask any three questions that they find relevant to this position, one at a time.

14
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,060
So by explicitly saying three questions, you're helping it to set limits to how long the interview

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,540
will last. And by asking it to ask one question at a time, you're telling the chatbot to make this

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,520
feel like a live in-person interview instead of having the chatbot list out the entire list of

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,060
interview questions all at once, which some chatbots I noticed will do unless you explicitly tell them

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,840
to ask questions one at a time. Here are more details on the process that you're going to ask

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,320
the chatbot to follow as an interviewer. And part of the reason I suggest being very detailed here

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,920
is because by default, a chatbot tends to output all the interview questions all at once, and

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,180
sometimes even starts to answer its own questions as if it is both the interviewer and interviewee.

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,060
So here's the process for this interview. So here you'll ask it to repeat this pattern

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,320
for the interview. Ask a prepared question. Wait for the interviewee to answer the question.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,780
Then ask a follow-up question based on the interviewee's reply. These follow-up questions

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,640
are really helpful because they really simulate what happens in a real interview, where the

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,240
direction that the interview takes is in part determined by your responses and the interviewer's

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,660
reaction to those responses. It also lets you practice moving the interview in a certain

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,640
direction because if you want to talk about something that really helps you stand out,

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,240
even if the question isn't directly asking about it, you can find some way to bring it up so that

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,400
then the interviewer, whether it's a chatbot or a real person, will then shift the conversation

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,100
towards that interesting topic that you just brought up. Okay, so let's continue on with the

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,160
instructions. Wait to allow the interviewee to respond to your follow-up question. And I'm putting

33
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,480
this here because sometimes the chatbot will ask a follow-up question and then immediately ask its

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,300
next prepared question. So this is reminding the chatbot to pause and really make this a two-way

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,620
back-and-forth conversation. The next step is after the interviewee responds to the follow-up question,

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,300
move on to the next prepared question. And remember earlier in the prompt, you've asked the interviewer

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,140
to ask three prepared interview questions. Finally, after you have asked your prepared question and

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,880
your follow-up questions, conclude the interview. And this is important because we don't want the

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,460
interview to go on indefinitely because the next step is asking the interviewer to provide feedback

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,800
on your interview performance. The last part of the prompt is to request feedback from the

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,880
interviewer. For each of the prepared questions, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,060
highest score. Provide some suggestions for how the interviewee can improve their interview answers.

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,160
So as you may recall from earlier in the course, chatbots can help you with qualitative scoring

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,720
of open-ended responses or essays. And so they can also give a qualitative score to your interview

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,760
responses. Now you don't have to treat these numeric scores as an absolute fact, and even for

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,920
these suggestions for how to improve, you can reflect on whether these apply to your situation.

47
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,880
But one thing that I think can be helpful is to practice receiving constructive criticism

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,600
graciously, because demonstrating that you can take feedback and work on improving based

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,780
on that feedback is something that interviewers will find very valuable.

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,019
So for privacy, both for myself and for any existing company that I worked for or worked

51
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,880
for in the past, I will practice the mock interview with a model that I can download

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
using LM Studio.

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll demonstrate with Gemma, which is the open source sibling of Gemini by Google.

54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,040
I think it does pretty well in asking one question at a time, asking follow-up questions that are related to my actual responses,

55
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,100
and it seems to do a good job of maintaining the role of an interviewer.

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,000
So I'll give it the instructions for playing the role of an interviewer, as well as the process I want it to follow for conducting the interview.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,740
So it does a good job of immediately jumping into the role right away, welcoming me to the interview, and asking the first question about cat body language.

58
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,340
And I'm trying my best to respond and also mention when a cat's body language may indicate anxiety.

59
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,020
The interviewer shows that they're actively listening because they pick on what I talked about in terms of tension and anxiety of a cat.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,240
It then moves on and asks me for a specific scenario where a client at a cat cafe may have misunderstood the cat's body language.

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,440
I try to respond that it would explain to the customer that both for the safety of the customer and the comfort of the cat,

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,960
to usually take a hands-off approach and let the cats approach the humans first.

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,920
And so the interviewer responds good example and ties this into their original question

64
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,500
about how body language might be misinterpreted.

65
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,380
Next, the interviewer asks me how I would handle a litter of new kittens that arrive at the cat cafe.

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,000
And I respond that adult cats and baby cats might behave differently

67
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,500
and recommend placing the kittens in a separate room where trained staff members can interact with the kittens

68
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,560
but leave a viewing window open to allow guests to watch the kittens from a safe distance.

69
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,040
And it looks like the interviewer picks up on my suggestion

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,140
and also seems to recommend giving the kittens a safe space.

71
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,760
And now the interviewer wraps up the interview

72
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,240
and now is giving me feedback on each of my responses to his questions.

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,380
The feedback it gives is a bit general,

74
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,560
mostly saying I could do more research on the topic it's asking about.

75
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
The cool thing is I've tried this out before filming

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
and I gave some really bad interview answers.

77
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,380
For example, I said that I'm really allergic to cats.

78
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:28,540
And some of the chatbots do a good job of pointing out that this is an issue and that maybe being a manager of a cat cafe may not be the best employment option for me.

79
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,320
So when you have a chance, please try this out for yourself.

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,680
Download a model onto your computer for privacy and prompt it to be an interviewer for a job that you're interested in.

81
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,240
Now, because I've tried this out with a couple chatbots, I will just tell you up front that this won't work all the time.

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,280
And depending on the large language model you're using, you may need to write different instructions

83
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,200
to get them to behave in the way that makes it feel like a natural interview.

84
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
But I found that even when a large language model isn't quite doing what I'm expecting it to do,

85
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,720
that's actually good practice for me to rewrite my prompts in a way to steer it in the direction

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,320
and the behavior that I'm looking for. Coming up next, you can actually have a chatbot chat with

87
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,939
another chatbot and collaborate to perform a task. And this could potentially give you better results

88
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,180
than if you were to work with just one chatbot.

89
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,960
Let's check out chatbot to chatbot collaboration next.
