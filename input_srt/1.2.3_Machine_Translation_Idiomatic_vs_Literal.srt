1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,640
It's a piece of cake.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm on the same page. I spilled the beans. I think I bit off more than I can chew.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,540
I let the cat out of the bag.

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,540
I'm still on the same page.

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,240
Some phrases have a direct word-for-word literal meaning, but they also have an alternative

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,540
implied or figurative meaning as well.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,680
These are called idioms.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,180
Let's take a look at how machine translation handles idioms.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,660
If you go to Google Translate and translate from English "a piece of cake" to Italian,

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,340
you'll get "un pezzo di torta" which is a slice of cake.

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,960
If you add this in front to make it "it was a piece of cake" the Italian translation

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,540
becomes "un gioco da ragazzi" a game for children.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,560
And if you add a sentence in front of that "she asked me if I could eat the grapefruit"

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,960
then "piece of cake" gets translated back into "a slice of cake" and I'm going to hide

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,860
save it for the end of the lecture, but if I make one tiny change, then it goes back again to

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,100
a game for children. So what's going on here? The phrase "a piece of cake" is an idiom which has

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,520
cultural meaning beyond the word-for-word literal meaning that it's a slice of sweet baked dessert.

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,360
Let's take a closer look at idioms and how translation models handle them. So here's a

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:44,060
piece of cake. In Italian, we say "un pezzo di torta". In French, this is "un par du gâteau".

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:53,960
In Arabic, this is "kutatun minal kake". In Chinese, this is "i kuei tangao". In Japanese, this is "keeki hito kire".

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,460
In Spanish, this is "un pedazo de pastel". This is the literal translation of the phrase "piece of cake"

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,479
in that it's not assuming any cultural meaning associated with it. Now let's see some alternative

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,140
translations for piece of cake in these same languages.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,740
In Italian, as you saw earlier, it's "un gioco da ragazzi" which literally means "a

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,060
game for children" or "child's play".

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,860
In French, it's "se du gâteau" which means "it's some cake".

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,780
It's almost the same as the literal translation that you saw earlier.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,920
And there are other idioms with a similar meaning which you'll learn about when you

29
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,680
get to the lessons about chatbots.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,960
In Arabic, this is "sehlel mithl shorbatin ma'an" and that means "easy as drinking water".

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,940
In Chinese, it's "siao cai i dia" which literally means "a side dish".

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,200
In Japanese, it's "asamishimae" which means "before breakfast" as in "so easy, you can

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,360
do it before breakfast".

34
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,240
In Spanish, it's "pan komedo" which literally means "eaten bread".

35
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,160
These are idioms in their respective languages.

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,960
And these particular idioms are used to describe something that's easy to do.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,060
For example, I took this intro course about modern AI, and it was a piece of cake.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,720
So let's take another look at these translations in action and try to think about how these

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,180
phrases can be interpreted, whether they're idiomatic or literal.

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,180
If it's just the phrase "it's a piece of cake", there isn't enough context to know

41
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,660
whether it's being used as an idiom or if it's a literal meaning.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,780
In this case, the model decides that you might mean this literally.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,420
Now when you add "it was" to the front, the model seems to decide that in this case,

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,400
it might be interpreted as the expression, the idiom.

45
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,740
So it finds the equivalent idiom in Italian: "a game for children" or "child's play".

46
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,220
If you add this sentence in front: "She asked me if I could eat the grapefruit, since what

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,819
follows is: it was a piece of cake."

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,040
The previous sentence provides context that perhaps what she said was a grapefruit is

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,760
in fact not a grapefruit but a slice of cake.

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,720
And now, to change it back to the idiomatic expression again, I actually just added a

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:05,980
period.

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,880
As you saw in the earlier lesson about context, you can see now that machine learning models

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,800
are not following strict rules but are trying to produce sensible output based on what they've

54
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
learned from looking at previous examples.

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,199
So it's not as if adding a period to the end of an idiom will always signal to the

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,720
model that it should use the idiomatic translation. In fact, it might be fun for you to try an idiom

57
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,160
of your choice and add context around it to try to change it back and forth between the idiomatic

58
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,020
and literal translation. Next, let's take a look at the distance between two words and how that

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,400
affects the translation.
