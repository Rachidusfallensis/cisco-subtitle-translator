00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,060
You may have heard the expression "every cloud has a silver lining".

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,300
Let's take a look at what that means and also what it doesn't mean.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,380
From a distance, this piece of artwork looks like a cloud.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,180
But if you change your perspective a little bit

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,380
and take a close look, it looks like it's actually made up of many silver lines.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,700
cool huh? This reminds me of a common expression, every cloud has a silver lining. People use this

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,500
saying to cheer up someone when something bad happens, and to tell them that maybe something

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,940
good comes out of something bad. Let's take a look at what this is, and also what it's not.

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,940
Let's motivate this with an example. Say you have a friend named Steve. He started his own company,

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
a fruit company, and he put a lot of work into this business. Unfortunately, one day, he was fired

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,520
from his job of running that fruit company. So he's really sad now, and you may be wondering what

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,680
you can do to help. Well, first, you may want to give Steve the space to acknowledge and feel those

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,400
sad emotions. You may recall experiencing similar emotions at some point in your life. Maybe you

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,500
applied to a job that you really liked, but you didn't get it. Or maybe you tried out for a dance

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,440
team and didn't make it into the team. So you may recall feeling sad, stressed, maybe even angry or

16
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,540
scared because of the uncertainty of what your future will look like. At this point, it's important

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,200
to acknowledge that it's okay to feel these emotions. And when your friend is going through

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,560
that situation, it's also important to let them know that it's okay for them to feel and express

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,140
their emotions. In psychology, this is called emotional validation. There's also an alternative

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,560
and somewhat instinctive urge to do something different, which is to try and fix things by

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,540
telling your friend, look on the bright side, or you should appreciate all the things that you have,

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,120
or maybe even saying you're better off this way. Even if this is coming out of good intentions,

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,800
the issue with saying these things is that it doesn't allow your friend to first feel their

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,220
emotions and doesn't let you demonstrate that you acknowledge and see that your friend is going

25
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,260
through a really difficult situation. In psychology, this is called toxic positivity in that it's

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,720
attempting to get someone to think positive without first acknowledging the real negatives

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,620
that they're going through. So there's a fine line. When you say every cloud has a silver lining,

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,180
you also want to acknowledge that the cloud is there too, that something bad happened. And you

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,700
want to give your friend that space to acknowledge that too. After that, you can start thinking about

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,420
the silver lining part. So why is it that sometimes when people look back on a difficult situation,

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,300
they actually think that situation turned out to be a good thing. Well, one reason is time. We all

32
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,980
have a limited amount of time in a day to pursue a job, project, or hobby. Sometimes when you get

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,240
turned down for a job or turned down for an opportunity to participate in a project, it means

34
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,540
that you now have the time and energy to devote to some other job or some other hobby or project.

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,839
Another reason why being rejected from your existing job or team could be a silver lining

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
is a change in your environment. You may really like your current environment, the people,

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,900
and the projects. But if you're forced to step out of that environment, such as take a new job,

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,940
or move to a new city, or join a new group of teammates, you may leave yourself open to new

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,020
opportunities that exist in that different environment. A related saying is, when one door

40
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:38,099
closes, another door opens. In economics, there's a related concept called opportunity cost. It says

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,980
that the job you have now has a cost associated with it because it's the cost of not having the

42
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,700
time and energy to devote to some other job or project. Let's hear from Steve in his own words

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,520
as he looks back at that moment when he was fired from his own company. I didn't see it then,

44
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,980
but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,079
to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner

46
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,900
again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,320
For some context, after Steve was fired from his own company, he went on to found other companies,

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,460
one called Next, another called Pixar. When Next was acquired by his original company,

49
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,620
Steve actually returned back to his original company, Apple.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,740
And that's Steve. Coming up next, you'll get to practice various ways that you can use chatbots.
