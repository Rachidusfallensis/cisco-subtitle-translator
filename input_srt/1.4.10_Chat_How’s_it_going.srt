1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,540
Have you ever wanted to vent to your friends, but none of your friends want to listen to it anymore?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,920
Now you can talk to a chatbot instead.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,460
You may be familiar with asking follow-up questions to a chatbot,

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,300
but it usually feels a bit like a one-sided conversation where you are the one leading the conversation.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,760
There are ways you can prompt a chatbot to take more initiative in moving the conversation forward.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,260
So let's take an example where you give the chatbot a role of a life coach.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,560
And here's the prompt.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,940
You ask it to take a non-judgmental approach.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,020
And you also ask it that if it has ideas for resolving or fixing a situation,

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,640
that it first asks the human to share their ideas before the chatbot life coach offers suggestions.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,440
I added this instruction here because by default,

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,400
chatbots may try their best to find solutions or fix things.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,920
But when you're dealing with people, sometimes what matters is that they want to be acknowledged

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,740
and have space to express their feelings and thoughts.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,300
And it's sometimes better to focus on giving people space before moving forward and suggesting

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,840
solutions or fixing things.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,500
The role description also asks the chatbot to leave the conversation open for additional

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,400
follow-ups instead of trying to wrap up the conversation.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,079
I added this here because the way chatbots tend to reply, it almost seems like they think

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,760
they only have one chance to respond. So they tend to wrap up their completions with some wording

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,860
that suggests that the conversation is over. So this prompt encourages the chatbot to continue

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,440
the conversation a bit longer. These instructions also ask the chatbot to assume that what is

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,220
outputting is what the human user is seeing or hearing. And so I'm asking the chatbot to not

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,960
output its internal monologue. And I added this instruction because for some of the language

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,319
models that I've tried, they would sometimes output their internal monologue or output a

26
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,760
description of what they're physically doing, like nodding their head attentively. So this prompt is

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,060
trying to encourage the chatbot to make this conversation feel more natural. I'm going to use

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,140
LM Studio and download a model onto my computer so that I can keep this conversation to myself.

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,520
I'll start off by giving it a prompt that will define its role as a life coach. It starts out by

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,839
asking me how I'm doing, and I reply, well, I don't know. For my birthday, my friend gave me breath

31
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,880
Notice how it responds by acknowledging my feelings first and asking me follow-up questions

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,880
about how I feel.

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,980
Normally, by default, a chatbot will tend to jump straight away to saying, "well, maybe

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,600
you have bad breath.

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
Let's see how we can fix that."

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,380
Here instead, the Life Coach chatbot is focused on learning more about how I feel.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,260
So my reply is, "well, I'm devastated.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,340
I wonder if this means that I have bad breath."

39
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,420
The Life Coach chatbot replies by first acknowledging the distress that I feel.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,380
It goes on to suggest that there may possibly be other ways of interpreting the situation,

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,160
and then asks me if there's another way to look at this situation.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,560
So it's cool, instead of telling me what to think, it's gently suggesting alternatives

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,460
and asking me to think of alternative ways to think about the situation.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
So I reply, well, yes, that's true.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,820
Maybe it's just to help me prepare for a situation where I really need to have good breath.

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,060
But maybe it means that my friend thinks that I smell bad.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
The life coach acknowledges my concerns.

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,220
It also points out some positives of my negative feelings, noting that it shows that I value

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,400
how others perceive me.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,420
And because I brought up bad breath, it then asks me if I would like some advice on dental

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,960
care and maintaining fresh breath.

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,800
So I say, oh sure.

53
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,740
It goes on to talk about self-care and dental care and tries not to be too pushy about it.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
So I reply, well, maybe later.

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm feeling really distraught.

56
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,900
So then it goes back to providing emotional support.

57
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,020
I say thank you.

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,820
And then it sort of wraps up the conversation there.

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,220
So I'd encourage you to actually try starting a conversation without first giving the chatbot

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,340
a particular role, and this will give you a sense of its default behavior.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,920
Depending on which chatbot you're using, it may understand that it's supposed to be attentive

62
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,440
and ask follow-up questions.

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,740
But if you find that the default behavior isn't quite what you're looking for, you can prompt

64
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,680
it to encourage it to have this two-way conversation, this dialogue between you and the chatbot.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,380
Up next, you'll ask a chatbot to help you with interview prep by asking it to play the

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,540
role of an interviewer in a mock interview.

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
Let's look at that next.
