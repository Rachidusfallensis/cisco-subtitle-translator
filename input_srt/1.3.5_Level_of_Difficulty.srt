00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,660
Some tasks are easier and some tasks are harder, so it's good to keep that in mind when asking a chatbot to perform a task.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,700
Here are some pairs of tasks, one easier and the other more challenging.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,960
You can instruct a chatbot to suggest some ways of saying I love you.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
Or, you could ask it to write a compelling movie script about two people who fall in love on a big boat.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,020
When comparing the two, one is a narrower task, whereas the other is a more complex, multi-step task, which makes it harder to do as well.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,560
Let's compare two other kinds of prompts.

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,120
One is, suggest a cake recipe.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,060
And the other is, solve this math problem.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,300
The first one can have more than one acceptable answer, whereas the other one requires reasoning and likely has only one correct answer.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,340
so it's more difficult to get correct. Let's compare these next two. You can ask a chatbot to

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,080
translate from English to Spanish, or you can ask it to translate from Latvian to Nepali. For the

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,940
first task, the large language model probably had more access to text data in English and Spanish,

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,980
and also text that included both English and Spanish together, such as a tourism website. In

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,060
comparison, the large language model probably had less training data related to Latvian and Nepali

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,220
compared to English and Spanish. Sometimes when using translation services, people even prefer

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,080
to first translate to English as an intermediate step and then translate from English to their

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,640
desired language because these models have more access to text data in English and so are more

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,200
likely to perform better when the task includes English. So what does this mean for you? Well,

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,799
it helps to be extra careful to check the model's output when you're asking it to do a more difficult

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,720
task. It also helps to use more powerful models for more difficult tasks, and as you'll soon see

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,040
in the next video, there are also benefits to using the less powerful models as well.

22
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,720
Coming up next, you'll learn about different groups of large language models that are available

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,619
to you for free, and get a better understanding of when you might want to use one or the other,

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,140
or maybe even more than one. Let's look into using multiple chatbots in the next video.
