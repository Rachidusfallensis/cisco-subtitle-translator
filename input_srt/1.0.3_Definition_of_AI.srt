1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,340
If you can't see me, and also can't hear me, but can text with me, would you consider me

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,080
intelligent? What if you communicated with a computer with text messages? Would you consider

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,260
it intelligent? Let's take a look at what this has to do with artificial intelligence,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,000
and look at how AI researchers have defined AI in the past.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,800
To define artificial intelligence, it helps to look at what some of the early founders of computer science and AI had to say about it.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,080
Alan Turing is considered one of the founders of theoretical computer science, and he provided the mathematical theory behind the modern-day computer.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,680
In 1950, Turing wrote a paper in which he asked,

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:54,100
He proposed a way of answering that question called the imitation game, in which a human observer has conversations by text with a human,

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,480
and also has a similar conversation with a machine.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,780
The observer cannot see or hear the other human or the machine,

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,220
so the observer has to decide purely on the quality of the text-based conversation

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,480
if the person on the other side is a human or not.

13
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,680
If the human cannot distinguish between the machine and the other human,

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,580
who is also communicating by text,

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,180
then that machine demonstrates the ability to think.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,900
This imitation game is now also called the Turing Test. As a historical note, there was actually a

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,260
pretty cool movie about Alan Turing and his team's efforts during the Second World War to decrypt the

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,580
military communications of Nazi Germany. The name of the movie is The Imitation Game. The exact term

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,980
artificial intelligence was first coined by another founder of computer science, John McCarthy.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:54,640
In 1952, McCarthy and other scientists met at Dartmouth College to propose a study of whether machines can be designed to simulate intelligence.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:08,600
They wrote that their research would be based on the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,280
McCarthy formally defined artificial intelligence as the science and engineering of making intelligent

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,100
machines. But how do we define intelligence? McCarthy defined intelligence as the computational

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,880
part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Another way to think about this is the ability to

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,919
perform useful tasks. So from a historical perspective, artificial intelligence is a field

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,660
of research that began in the 1950s with the goal of getting machines to perform tasks that require

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,960
intelligence. Let's break this down a bit. Artificial and machine means that it's not performed

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,740
by biological intelligence, like a human, a dog, or a panda. It's task-oriented. The machine is

29
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,079
taking some action, like outputting a number or some text, to achieve a useful outcome. The third

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,440
part is intelligence. And defining intelligence can get somewhat philosophical, but intelligence

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,760
includes the ability to make decisions even in ambiguous circumstances, and to learn from

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,900
experience. Intelligence is often defined in terms of what humans are able to do, although it doesn't

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,180
have to be limited to human intelligence. Next, let's take a closer look at defining intelligence.
