00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,520
Oh, hello there. I was just enhancing my productivity. Really? Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,060
Let me explain something called incubation theory. What if you're working on a problem or a task,

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,320
and it's really hard, and you're spending a lot of time on it? One thing you could do

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,240
is to just keep trying to figure out the answer. Don't take breaks, don't sleep, don't eat,

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,780
and just keep working at it until you get the solution. Another approach is to take a break,

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,580
relax, do something else, take a nap, get some food, maybe give yourself a day to sleep on it,

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,100
then come back to the problem. What you might find when you try this out is that taking that break

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,239
actually helps you get the insight or new perspective to help you with that task. So why

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,500
is that psychologists have looked into why this happens, and here are what their studies suggest.

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,220
One idea is called unconscious thought. Even when you're not actively thinking about solving a

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,100
particular task, your mind is still processing that information. Occasionally, your mind will

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,340
jump back in and maybe daydream about that topic or task. This time spent daydreaming helps you

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,280
think differently to help you with your task. Another concept is called remote association.

14
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,880
For example, let's say you're very familiar with ice cream and you're also very familiar with cakes.

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,440
One day, you realize that you can combine ice cream and cake to create ice cream cake.

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,280
So when you give yourself that time to step away from a task or problem, it allows your brain to make connections between things that may help you.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,420
Another idea is rest and recovery.

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,280
When you give yourself a break, this allows your brain to recover so that it can perform better when you go back to the task.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,440
And there's also something called selective forgetting.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,600
Sometimes, when you're trying to solve a problem, you may take a path that leads to a dead end.

21
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:08,380
Selective forgetting, the way a goldfish is able to forget, may free up your brain to choose a different path to perform the task.

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,080
So all of these ideas are collectively part of something psychologists call incubation theory.

23
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,420
Incubation theory suggests that you step away from your task, let it sit or incubate, and

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,880
then when you come back, it will hatch into a baby chick.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,420
Or you'll find more and possibly better ways to perform a task.

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,740
So the steps you might take are the following.

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,900
First, try to solve the problem.

28
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,440
This helps you better understand the problem and possible solutions.

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,980
That's called preparation.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,320
Then take a break.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
That's called incubation.

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,920
Taking a break could be switching to a different task.

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,760
Preferably something that allows you to free up your mind enough to daydream and occasionally

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,980
still think about the task you're trying to solve.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,460
It could also include exercise, which also helps your brain's performance in general.

36
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,380
It could be sleeping, such as taking short naps.

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,200
You might find that you get some ideas in your dreams or as you're waking up from a

38
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,360
dream.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,180
After you give your brain some time to incubate, then you reach the idea that's called illumination.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,780
Then you can check if your solution, your new idea, is correct and if it works.

41
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,800
That's called the verification step.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,440
So next time you're feeling stuck, maybe take a short break.

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,460
And you may find that's exactly what you needed.

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,580
