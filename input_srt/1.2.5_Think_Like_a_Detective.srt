1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,100
What do you think this is?

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,740
What if you interact with it and play around with it?

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,020
Now what do you think this is?

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,220
Just as interacting with an object will help you better learn what it is and how it works,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,180
interacting with AI will also help you better learn about it too.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,120
When you're learning about AI, or anything really,

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,440
I recommend thinking like a detective and checking if the app or model is doing what you think it is.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,760
For example, would you accept this translation as it's given, or do you want to explore this a bit more?

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,840
First, you can take a closer look.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,720
Let's look at each of these sentences one by one.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,240
Some of these phrases appear to be idioms, or expressions with cultural meaning beyond their literal word-for-word meaning.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,160
Let's make this easier to inspect by breaking this up into smaller pieces.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,560
So let's remove the first and last sentence and keep the middle one.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,480
And try to change the input, whatever options you can change, one at a time.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
For example, I'll change this from

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,180
And look, the translation changed from

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,299
If you've taken the earlier lessons, you may recall that

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,520
Jogo da ragazzi is a child's game or child's play, and un pezzo di torta means a slice of cake.

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,140
So make changes one at a time, and maybe you can look for patterns. For example, if you change it to

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,740
I realized it was a piece of cake, the translation model assumes the idiomatic meaning of this phrase.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,280
If you change it to I saw that it was a piece of cake, it interprets this as the literal translation.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,880
If you change it to, I recognized that it was a piece of cake, the model goes back to the idiomatic translation.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:03,040
So you can now see that when the sentence is about what I realize or recognize, something describing what's in my mind, the translation model uses the idiomatic equivalent.

24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,759
When the word choice sounds more like it's what I see in front of me with my eyes, it uses the literal translation.

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,580
And it's still helpful, maybe even more helpful, to notice when the model doesn't work or doesn't fit a pattern.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,880
For instance, if you change it to, I could see that it was a piece of cake, even though

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,220
it's technically another version of I saw with my eyes, this gets interpreted as the

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,520
idiom, a piece of cake.

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,340
I recommend one way to test out an app or task is to give inputs where you know what

30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,580
the desired result would be.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,040
Then you'll have a way to check whether it's working as expected or doing something unexpected.

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,660
Coming up next, you'll learn about chatbots, how they behave, and how you can make the

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,120
of using them. This practice of thinking like a detective will help you when you learn about

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,520
and interact with chatbots. See you soon!
