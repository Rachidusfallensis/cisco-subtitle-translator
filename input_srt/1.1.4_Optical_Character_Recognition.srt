00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,220
Have you ever picked up a receipt or a brochure or seen a sign on the wall and found yourself

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,940
typing the text into your phone? What if instead you could take a picture of it and then let your

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,420
phone get the text from it for you? Let's take a look at optical character recognition and how it

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,640
lets you do that. Let's say you took a picture of a sign that you thought was interesting and you

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,600
want to send it to your friend, Frances Ko. Frances replies that she can't read what the

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,660
sign says and asks you to type it out. So you could try to type it out by hand, but then you remember

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,800
that you can use computer vision on your phone. So if you're using Google Photos, you can click on

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,920
the lens icon, then it looks for parts of the image that look like characters of a language,

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,160
in this case English. Then it lets you select the text that you want to further process.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,620
So then you can click copy. Then you can go back to your message to Frances, paste in the text,

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,120
and send it. So this kind of computer vision task that looks for characters of a language

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,620
and attempts to identify and recognize those characters in order to output regular text,

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,060
this is called optical character recognition, often shortened to the acronym OCR. So what is OCR

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,100
doing? The software identifies a bounding box around each part of the image that appears to

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,319
contain a character in a language. Then, for each bounding box, it classifies that as one of those

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,600
letters. So optical character recognition is actually an application of object detection,

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,260
because it's first localizing where the text appears in an image, and then it's identifying

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,560
whether it's letter A, B, C, D, all the way to Z, as well as punctuation like commas, periods,

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,900
dollar signs, and so on. So I'd like to go back and point out one thing you might have noticed.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,999
The text that you got from optical character recognition looked like this, and you can see here

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,020
the text doesn't seem quite understandable. First, there's this line, Leawood Walk of F,

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,780
and below that, just Holly. Let's go back to the image and take a closer look. If you zoom in,

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,960
here's part of the image that the software is having trouble with. The text is written on the

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,880
inside of a circle. Here you can see that Leawood Walk of Fame, and here is Holly. So why do you

25
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,379
think it output the text like this? Well, most text, like in a document or a book, is written in

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,480
straight lines. And for many languages like English, text flows from left to right, then top

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,180
to bottom. So it looks like the OCR software was detecting text from top to bottom, and it assumed

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,860
that Leawood walk of F was on one line, and the next line below that was Holly. And so one common

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,760
theme that you'll see throughout this course is that even though AI-enabled software can do pretty

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,739
cool things, you as the user and the human still play an important role in checking whether the

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,440
output makes sense, so it's still up to you to make adjustments as necessary. The other point I'd

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,400
like to make is that when something doesn't work, it might be a chance to learn. For instance,

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,240
when something like this isn't working quite right, if you can figure out why it's not working the

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,760
way you expect it to, then you might get a better understanding of how this application or this

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,280
software works and how you can use it. Another scenario where you could use optical character

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,159
recognition is when you take pictures of your receipts after you go to a restaurant or grocery

37
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,480
store. You can use OCR to extract the items that you purchased, as well as the prices that you paid

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,080
for them. And what if you're traveling and you took a picture of this sign at an outdoor food market?

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,900
This app has another button, Translate, and it looks like it performs OCR on parts of the image

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,040
with Chinese characters, then translate that text into English and overlays the English on top of

41
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,779
that. You'll learn more about machine translation later on in the rest of this course. You can also

42
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,920
apply these computer vision tasks that you saw in the previous couple videos on your computer inside

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
a web browser. If you use Google Chrome web browser, you can open up the menu on the top right and then

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,160
click on "Search with Google Lens". Select the area you want to search or extract text from and you

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,440
can copy that text. You can also translate that text and select objects and images to search as

46
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,659
well. Coming up next, I'll share some tips on why taking a break may help you with your studies and

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,980
your work. So please take a short break and then check out the next video to see why it's good for you.
