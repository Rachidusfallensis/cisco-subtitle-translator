00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,700
Can you see the facial expression on this emoji ball?

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,520
How about this emoji ball?

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,480
And how about this emoji ball?

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,059
Just as the distance between you and another object can affect how well you can see it,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,800
the distance between two words in a piece of text can affect how well a machine translation can figure out the relationship between those two.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,820
Let's see an example of that.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,480
You've seen how the context of other words around any given word has an influence on how that word is translated.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,980
Something helpful to keep in mind is that the distance between these two words can affect how much influence one word has on the other.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,540
Here's a small piece of text.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,620
She asked,

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Who ate the salad?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,740
I replied,

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,420
It looked delicious, so I ate it.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,100
In Spanish, the word for salad is la ensalada, and the word it refers to a salad.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,580
In Spanish, it is translated to the word la.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm going to add some text, which I'm hiding for now,

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,680
but if you increase the distance between the word for salad and the word for it,

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,720
notice at the bottom, the word for it went from la to lo.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,860
This is an interesting aspect of language and language translation

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,720
that will be helpful for you to know as you verify the results that you get

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,360
from a machine translation model.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
So let's take a closer look.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,020
In Spanish, the word for it is either lo when it's referring to a word that has a masculine gender,

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,600
or it's la when it refers to a noun that has a feminine gender.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,560
When the pronoun for it matches the gender of the noun that it's referring to, this is called gender agreement.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,720
And something interesting happens when the pronoun and the noun that it's referring to are too far apart.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,820
The translation model may no longer be able to recognize the connection between those two words anymore.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
So here you see I've added a bunch of text in the middle.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,140
The result is it now says lo, the masculine version for it, when it should say la, the feminine pronoun for it.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,800
The adjective delicious is now delicioso when it should be the feminine gendered deliciosa.

31
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,540
And it seems to default to the masculine gender when it's not sure.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,520
So this is just something important to keep in mind when you're reviewing the translations that you get from a machine learning model.

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,760
And just if you're curious, in natural language processing, this task of making sure that pronouns and adjectives are aligned,

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,680
or generally to determine when two pieces of text are referring to the same thing, such as a salad,

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,480
this task is called co-reference resolution.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,520
And you see here that co-reference resolution can become more challenging when the two pieces of text are much further apart from each other.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,340
Something fun for you to try is to see what other ways of inserting text between the noun and its

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,460
pronoun can make it more challenging for the translation model to maintain that connection

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,180
between the two. Here is just a demonstration of what I was doing in order to see if I could break

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,800
the connection between the word for salad and the word for it. Next up is a short study tip,

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,780
think like a detective. I've spent the past few years coaching engineers to be good teachers,

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,000
and I've often asked them to think like a detective,

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,320
so I'd like to share the same advice with you as well.
