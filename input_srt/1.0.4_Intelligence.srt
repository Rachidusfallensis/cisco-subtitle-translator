1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,260
Does performing this task require intelligence?

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,240
How about this?

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,840
Does this require intelligence?

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,219
How about this?

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,860
Some tasks are harder than others,

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,260
so we'd say they require more intelligence.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,980
Let's take a look at some tasks that we can do.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,400
tasks that have different levels of difficulty to better understand what is considered intelligence.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,760
Here is an image in a photo app. How would you instruct a computer to convert the image to

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,860
grayscale? You can apply a math formula that takes an average of the red, green, and blue to convert

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,360
it to grayscale. Since this task can be accomplished pretty consistently with some math, we wouldn't

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,920
consider this to acquire much intelligence. How about if you crop the image? If you give the machine

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,920
the exact size and shape that you want to crop, the machine can perform this task well by following

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,880
some simple rules. So this wouldn't require much intelligence. But what if you ask the machine

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,100
to choose how to crop the image? This task is more nuanced because the computer needs to figure out

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,060
what it should keep in the image and what it should leave out. For instance, it probably should keep

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,060
the person and other relevant objects inside the image after cropping. So this may require some more

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,500
intelligence to do the task well. What if you wanted the computer to identify some of the objects

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,440
in the image and tell you what they are? For instance, I'd like to identify what these round

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,160
objects are. This task is harder for a computer to do well with a few simple instructions because

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,720
there are many other objects that are round and white, and so doing a simple match based on color

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,340
or shape probably won't be enough. You could imagine all the rules you might need to give the machine

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,360
and also exceptions to those rules in order to do this task well.

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,060
So it's fair to say that this task requires more intelligence.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,080
What if you want to make an object in the image disappear?

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,160
This eraser lets me hand draw a circle around some object,

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,620
and it cleanly removes that object.

28
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,800
But instead of just leaving an empty hole where the object was,

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,200
it fills in the missing space quite well with what would reasonably be behind that object.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,900
And by the way, I was able to make that round steamed bun disappear without a photo app by eating it.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,900
If you imagine giving a computer instructions for how to do this, it would require a lot of instructions,

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,920
and even then, you might not even be able to think of all the instructions and exceptions that are needed to perform this task well in most situations.

33
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,540
So this task probably requires more intelligence too.

34
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,400
One way to think of intelligence is the ability to perform tasks that humans do well, such as

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,820
understanding images, text, and language. And it helps to think of these as a spectrum of tasks

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,000
that may be easier or harder for a machine or even a human to do. An easier task would require

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,120
fewer rules, whereas a more difficult task would require more rules. You can think of the difficulty

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,679
of a task in terms of how many rules and exceptions to those rules you'd have to give a machine in

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,160
order for it to do the task well. To perform well on a difficult task, a person or computer would

40
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,220
ideally be able to handle ambiguity. This means they can handle situations that they haven't

41
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,360
encountered before and still achieve a reasonable outcome. In the early days of AI research,

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,980
writing these rules allowed machines to perform some useful tasks with images, text, and numbers.

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,180
But what happens when giving lots of rules and instructions just isn't enough? Coming up next,

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,440
There's another approach in AI that doesn't rely on humans to come up with these rules and instructions.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,240
It's called machine learning.

46
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,320
Let's look at machine learning next.
