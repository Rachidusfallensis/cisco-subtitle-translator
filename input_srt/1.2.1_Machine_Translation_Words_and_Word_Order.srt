1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,800
Do you speak English?

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,600
Do you speak English?

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,400
Wouldn't it be nice if you had a translator when you needed one?

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,219
Well, thankfully, if you have a phone or computer, you actually do.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,580
Where is the bathroom?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,800
O se trouven les toilettes?

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,180
Let's take a closer look at machine translation.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,420
If you send a Spanish word, llamas, to a translation service, like Google Translate, you might get this:

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,620
this. "Lamas" in Spanish means "flames" in English. And if you add this, "Lamas adorables"

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,320
is translated to "Adorable llamas" in English. The flames have been replaced with "lamas".

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,380
And if you remove this and add this, you get "como te llamas" in Spanish, which means "What

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,560
is your name" in English. So, no llamas and no flames either. So what's going on here?

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's take a closer look at how machine translation interprets individual words.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,240
For many words, you wouldn't really need machine translation.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,640
You could just look it up in a bilingual dictionary.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,720
"Salad" in English is "ensalada" in Spanish.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,600
"Eat" in English is "comer" in Spanish.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,640
And "fresh" in English is "fresco" or "fresca".

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,560
But let's look at this word, "light".

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,439
You could translate it to "la luz" as in "light from sunlight" or "light from a light bulb".

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,700
And you could also translate this to "ligera" as in "light as a feather".

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,520
And as you saw earlier, "llamas" can be translated to "flames" as in "flames at a campfire".

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,360
Or it could also be translated to "llamas" the cute animals with long necks.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,940
Or "llamas" can be part of this phrase "como te llamas" where "llamas" means "to call oneself".

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,279
So "como te llamas" is Spanish for "what is your name?"

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,060
So there are some words that look the same and sound the same.

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,200
Here's one more example.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,420
The word "bank" in English could be translated to "banco" as in a financial institution

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
where you can deposit your money.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,260
It could also be translated to "orilla" which is the land next to a river.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,220
And to make things even more fun, the Spanish word for "banco" can be a bank where you

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,680
deposit your money, but can also be a bench that you sit on at a park.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,480
These words, light, llamas, bank, banco, are examples of two or more distinct words with

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,920
their own distinct meanings that happen to look the same and also sound the same.

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,160
If two distinct words have the same spelling and pronunciation, they're called homonyms.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,740
There are also words that look the same but don't necessarily sound the same.

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,759
Here's an example: This word could be pronounced "tear" as in "It's tearing up my heart when

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm with you. And that could be translated to "se me parte", although apparently there are many

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,120
words that you can use to describe a broken heart. This word could also be pronounced "tear" as in

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,340
"save your tears for another day". And the Spanish for that is "lágrima". In this case, there are two

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,580
distinct words "tear" and "tear" with different meanings and they look the same but in this case

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,740
don't sound the same. When two distinct words have the same spelling and "may" or "may not" have the

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,500
pronunciation, these are called homographs. So homonyms are a special case of homographs that

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
not only look the same but sound the same. You don't need to remember these specific terms when

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,780
you're learning about AI, but it helps to remember that when two distinct words at least look the

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,080
same, then this can be a challenging task for a machine translation service. Now let's go beyond

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,460
single words and look at a sentence. In English, I ate the salad when translated to Hindi is this:

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,160
If we don't know anything about Hindi, then we might guess that each of these three words are

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,580
I ate the salad. But let's play the audio.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,180
It actually sounds like the middle word is "salad" instead of "ate".

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,600
So "I ate the salad" is translated to "many salad kaya".

52
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,700
If you match up the words, "I" is "many the salad" "salad ate" "kaya".

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,840
So it's literally "I ate."

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,100
In English, sentences follow the pattern "subject", "verb", then the object that the verb is acting on.

55
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,400
"I ate the salad."

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,920
In Hindi, the pattern is "subject object verb" as in "I ate."

57
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,120
Japanese is also similar in that the verb comes after the object.

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,760
So, word order varies depending on which language you're translating from and to.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,140
Let's look at something called dropped pronouns.

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,020
I ate, in English, is yo comi in Spanish.

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,220
I ate the salad is comi la ensalada.

62
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Notice that the word yo just disappeared.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
Yo, what's up with that?

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,460
I ate the fresh salad is comi la ensalada fresca.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,980
Let's take a closer look at this.

66
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,720
The English, I ate the fresh salad, translates in Spanish to yo comi la ensalada fresca.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,880
So this is I ate the salad fresh.

68
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,920
So this is another example of word order differences.

69
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,700
In English, the adjective goes first, followed by the noun.

70
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,840
This is the same for other languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

71
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,120
In Spanish, the noun comes first, followed by the adjective salad fresh.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,660
This is the same for other languages like French, Arabic, and Hindi.

73
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,120
So again, the word order depends on the language that you're translating from or translating to.

74
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,440
And you may have noticed that the word yo disappeared earlier.

75
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,020
In Spanish, you can drop the pronoun yo and it would read just fine as

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,900
Comí la ensalada fresca.

77
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,900
Languages like Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese that let you drop the pronoun in sentences

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,260
are called pro-drop languages.

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,680
Now, you don't need to remember the term pro-drop,

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,820
But the point of these examples is to show you how word order, and even whether a word

81
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,720
needs to appear or not, makes the task of translating both interesting and complicated.

82
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,980
And so these are things to look out for whenever you use a translation service.

83
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,960
Coming up next, the context surrounding a word can affect how it's translated.

84
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,540
To get more context on what I'm talking about, please go on to the next video.
