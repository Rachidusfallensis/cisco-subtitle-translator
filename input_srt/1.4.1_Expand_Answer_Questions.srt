00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,520
You've probably used chatbots in the same way that you use web search, by asking it a question and getting an answer.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:18,940
This is an example of an expand task in that you give it a small input, such as, who is Taylor Swift, and you get a lot of information back.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,180
Let's take a look at how you can use chatbots for question answering.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,260
Let's look at various ways that you can ask for information from a chatbot.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,640
We can start with asking a question such as "What is K-pop and hip-hop?"

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,040
Let's see what the chatbot says.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,600
Beyond asking a question, you can also request information with explicit instructions.

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,159
For example, you can say "Compare and contrast" or "List" or "Describe" or "Explain".

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,140
And you can give your prompt more structure with a sequence of subtasks.

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,300
For example, list some resources, then collect key information like persons and terminology,

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,580
then list out similarities, and then list out differences, and finally draw some conclusions.

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,560
So it's nice that when you give your prompt more structure and also flesh out what you're looking

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,639
for, it also will prompt the chatbot to follow your structure and also provide more information

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:30,720
that you're asking for. And you can ask follow-up questions or add follow-up instructions. For

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,580
example, for the previous two topics, divide your analysis into two parts. Compare and contrast the

16
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,640
music, and then compare and contrast the dance style. Notice that you could have also included

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,239
this in the previous prompt so that it's just one long prompt. But sometimes you may get better

18
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,700
results if you break up your task into separate prompts. If you ask a chatbot to do too many

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,840
things, it may not do all of them that well compared to if it was able to focus on fewer

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,760
tasks at the same time. And let's see what it says.

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,539
And you can ask it to review its previous work. Sometimes it can spot its own mistakes

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,560
if you just ask it to double check. People have been calling this prompting technique

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,460
reflection because the model is asked to reflect on its previous completions to check if they can

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,600
be improved or corrected. So for instance, you can ask it to check for factual accuracy

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,660
and also ask it to add any additional information. Asking a chatbot to review its work can make a

26
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,799
difference because once a chatbot predicts a word, it only moves onto the next word and the next and

27
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,600
can't go back to change or remove any word that it's already output. And to make it easier to see

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,920
what it decided to revise, I'll ask it to copy over its original output that it reviewed,

29
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,080
followed by the clarification or addition. I'm calling these key and value because that's a

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,100
common way that software engineers like to organize information. If you're not familiar with key-value

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,199
pairs, don't worry, you can write your prompt without explicitly using these vocabulary words

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,600
and it will probably still work. And let's see what it says.

33
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,780
You can go deeper into subtopics based on what you learned from its previous completions.

34
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,740
For instance, I can say, you mentioned breaking, breakdancing. Can you clarify what this is?

35
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:47,920
You can think of this as just asking another follow-up question, but I'd like to mention this because you may sometimes feel like a chatbot's answer didn't give you the depth of information that you were looking for when you first asked for it.

36
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,880
But if you focus on a narrower subtopic, you may get more details than you did in the first more general request.

37
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,080
And so I'll actually ask two follow-up questions.

38
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,620
The second one will be, what is the difference between breaking and breakdancing?

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,260
So the first question is, I'll ask it to clarify breaking or breakdancing.

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
And then my next follow-up is, what's the difference between breaking and breakdancing?

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,160
And so it clarifies that the preferred term is breaking as opposed to breakdancing.

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,240
So far, you've seen questions or instructions that ask about a keyword such as hip-hop or breaking.

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,320
What if instead you have a fuzzy recollection of a word or concept and need a reminder of what that is?

44
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,380
You can ask a chatbot to fill in the blanks for you.

45
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,160
For example, I'll ask it for words or terminology that describe this,

46
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,060
and then I'll describe what I'm thinking of as best I can.

47
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,260
someone sees their friends doing fun stuff on social media, and it makes them feel bad.

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,160
One thing I'd like to point out is I worded this so that I'm trying to encourage the chatbot to

49
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,360
give multiple suggestions for what this keyword or terminology could be by using the plural words

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,160
as opposed to singular word. Sometimes if I don't hint that I want multiple options,

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,140
it will just give me one result. Let's see if the chatbot can help me fill in the blanks.

52
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,200
So it looks like the word I was thinking of was FOMO, but it also lists other possible

53
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,180
words or phrases that I didn't think about and that I can ask follow-up questions about.

54
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,560
So it also mentions other things like social comparison and asks me if I want to learn

55
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,680
more, and I say yes.

56
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,980
And now it provides more detailed definitions of all those words it suggested, as well as

57
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,880
some strategies for coping with social media envy.

58
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,320
You can also interact with chatbots in a way that you probably wouldn't with a regular search engine.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,780
You can try to clarify maybe some confusion about some topic.

60
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,400
For example, I wanted clarification on this.

61
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,980
When people announce some accomplishment, they either say they're proud of that accomplishment,

62
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,400
but other people say they're humbled by their accomplishment or award.

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,480
So my question is, do these mean the same thing?

64
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,620
And why do people say one versus the other?

65
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,860
Let's try this out.

66
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,180
So it defines proud of and it defines humbled by and tries to explain why people choose one or the

67
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,760
other based on personal preferences, culture, or situation. Now I've tried this with a couple

68
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,700
different chatbots and they all gave similar safe answers that are some version of, well,

69
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,859
it depends on the person or it depends on the culture. What I thought was interesting with this

70
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,320
answered by Claude was that it mentioned something that's kind of an opinion or maybe even an insight.

71
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,120
It says, it's worth noting that humbled by is sometimes criticized as false modesty. And so,

72
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,480
it's not necessarily that you have to believe what it's saying, but it's trying to provide some

73
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,160
additional opinion or insight that you might get when you're talking to a human. So it's helpful to

74
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,679
try out the same prompt or question or task on more than one chatbot. You might learn more than

75
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,580
if you just stuck with just one. Coming up next, you'll use chatbots to help you generate

76
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,100
new ideas. I'll see you in the next video.
