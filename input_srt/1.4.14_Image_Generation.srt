00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,480
One particular tool you'll come across when you work with chatbots is an image generation tool.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,200
Let's see how you can use tools to help you generate images.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,680
Image generation is done by more than one category of models, but most recently,

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,720
the category of models that have been performing really well are called diffusion models.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,360
The way diffusion models work is they start with an image that's just a bunch of random pixels,

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,700
which we call noise.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,740
A diffusion model slowly removes some of that noise a bit at a time,

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,580
as if it expects that there is an image underneath all that noise.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,560
And it does this in a repeated iterative process.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,340
Each time, it looks at the image as if there is a coherent picture or painting

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,280
behind all that random noise, and it tries to remove that noise.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,660
When it's removed enough of the noise, then you get an image.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,500
And something I'll point out here is that in those earlier iterations,

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,700
it's not that the model already knows what the final image looks like behind all that noise.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,280
So those green lines that you see in the earlier iterations could have turned into a frog,

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,220
but could have also turned into a turtle or a tree.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,520
To guide a diffusion model to create a specific image,

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,100
the models are trained to take in both an image and text label that describes that image.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,460
So when you use a diffusion model, you'll include a prompt that describes the image that you're hoping for,

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,640
such as frog with a balloon.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,880
The diffusion model attempts to create an image that matches this text.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
Some people have described this process as similar to when a sculptor starts with a rock and carves out a statue.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,840
One of my friends actually said it reminded him of this quote.

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,460
I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,860
This quote is by the artist Michelangelo.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,900
There are several sites that let you try out image generation.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,960
I'll demonstrate this with Meta AI.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,020
You can click on this pen icon on the left, which takes you to the page that generates images.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,460
So I'll ask it to generate an image of a pineapple cake.

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,380
So these are pretty nice images of pineapple cakes.

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,080
But I was actually thinking about a particular kind of pineapple cake.

32
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,619
So let me be more specific.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,140
Generate an image of a Taiwanese pineapple cake.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,340
So that's actually closer to what I was thinking about,

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,900
because Taiwanese pineapple cakes are rectangular and have that kind of flaky texture on the outside.

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Similar to when you prompt a large language model,

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,580
when you prompt a diffusion model, you can give more detail in your prompt to describe the image that you want.

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,420
I can say a frog holding a red balloon.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,920
Then if I add in the style of a Banksy,

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,000
it changes this to a slightly more cartoonish looking image of a frog holding a red balloon.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,960
These image generation models are also provided as tools that a large language model has access to.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,620
For instance, if you go to chatGPT and ask it to generate an image,

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,260
the chatbot will actually call an image generation model, in this case, Dolly3 by OpenAI.

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,900
So I can ask within chatGPT, generate an image of a purple emoji ball.

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,260
So that's pretty good. I had something slightly different in mind.

46
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,060
I'll ask it to generate four images of a purple emoji ball where the emoji ball is a stress ball.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,380
So it looks like it's output images that have a softer texture as if it's a squishy rubber ball.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,860
Sometimes you may encounter a copyright restriction if you ask a model to generate an image in the style of a famous artist.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,560
For example, I can ask in chat GPT to generate an image of a frog holding a red balloon, and that's fine.

50
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,880
Now, if I ask it to generate a frog holding a red balloon in the style of a Banksy, here's what it says.

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,600
It wasn't able to generate the image due to content policy restrictions.

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,360
And it's helpful to keep in mind that even when there aren't restrictions placed on the particular software that you're using,

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,500
it's probably best to avoid generating images that you think might be harmful to other people.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,460
Oftentimes, we as society rely on photographs to reflect reality.

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,380
So it's important to be careful about generating images that look like realistic photographs,

56
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,280
especially images of people.

57
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,520
Coming up next, you'll practice using personal assistants to help you use apps on your phone.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,260
Hey Siri!

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:14,800
Hey Google!

60
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:16,299
Alexa!
