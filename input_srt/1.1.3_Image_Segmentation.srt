00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,340
If you have any friends who are into photography, they may love to tell you how they can use their

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,140
professional camera to blur the background in photos. If you don't have a professional camera

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,000
yourself, you can still do that with your regular phone and AI. Let's see how that works with

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,640
something called image segmentation. In most photo apps, you can create a portrait effect

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,060
by blurring the background. For example, in Google Photos, you can click on Edit and then click on

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,120
Portrait. Notice that it's blurring the image, but not the whole image, just the background behind me.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
So again, here is the original image, and here is the image with the blurred background. This is

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,540
called the Bokeh effect, and people like that it helps the viewer focus their attention on the

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
subject of the photo. And don't worry, Bokeh effect is not an AI-related word that you need to

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,200
remember. Photographers love talking about the bokeh effect, so it's just a nice word to know

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,720
in case you're friends with a photographer. The photo app is able to identify specifically which

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,460
parts of an image represent the person in the foreground as opposed to everything else in the

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,740
background on a pixel by pixel level. And by pixel, I'm referring to all the tiny little dots that

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,860
make up a digital photograph. Here's what I mean. If you look at just a small section of the

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,260
photograph and then zoom in. Imagine if we zoomed in enough that we're actually looking at all the

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,820
pixels that make up an image. It's essentially like a spreadsheet where every cell of the spreadsheet

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,540
has a number that defines how much red, how much green, and how much blue is in that particular

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,340
pixel. And in order to generate this portrait photo effect, the software attempts to identify

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,840
for every pixel whether that pixel is part of the object in the foreground, or

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,400
or is part of the background.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,620
So, the ability to determine which pixel represents the person and which pixel represents the

22
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,740
background is a computer vision task called image segmentation.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Note, I am skipping over some additional processing that goes in in order to identify the foreground

24
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,500
versus the background, and this is called depth perception, but it is possible to just rely on

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,180
image segmentation to create this portrait effect, so for now don't worry about remembering what

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,000
depth perception is. The output of image segmentation is actually going to be something

27
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,280
that looks like an image with the same height and width of the original photograph, but where each

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,500
pixel is given a value of 0 or 1. In this case, I'm representing the 1 values with the color white

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,560
and the zero values with the color black. But these can be any color for visualization purposes.

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,000
The computer itself just sees a spreadsheet-like grid of zeros and ones. So a value of one indicates

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,180
that a pixel from the original image is part of the segmented object, in this case the person.

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,560
A value of zero represents anything that was not part of the segmented object. In this case,

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,760
that's the background. This image of just zeros and ones is called a mask. You can think of it the

34
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,740
same way you think of a mask you wear for a costume. It outlines particular areas of the image,

35
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,380
just like a mask that you might wear if you're a superhero or just attending some dress-up event

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,580
outlines a certain area of your face. And this mask can then be used downstream for other steps

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,200
in the software application to process just the pixels that are the person or just the pixels that

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,020
are in the background. So here's what you can do to get the blur effect. So here's the original image,

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,580
And here is the mask. And here is where we want to store just the pixels of the person in the

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,700
foreground. For this pixel, let's say the value is 125. And in the mask, the value at that same

41
00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:01,520
location is 0. So 125 times 0 is 0. And let's put a 0 here. Let's try another pixel here. Let's say

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:10,720
it's 150. In the mask, the value at the same location is 1. 150 times 1 is 150. So let's save

43
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,680
that here. And if you do that for all the pixels, you'll get an image that has the same pixels of

44
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,799
the subject, like this. And I'm simplifying a little bit for the sake of clarity. Normally,

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,520
for color photos, every pixel stores three values. One for how much red, how much green,

46
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,880
and how much blue, and that mixes together to produce the color. The next step is to go back

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,080
to the original image and blur the whole thing. Yes, the background and even the subject in the

48
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,660
foreground. Everything. I'll explain why in a bit. Then, take this subject that you carved out using

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,960
the segmentation mask and overlay it on top of the blurred image. And that's how you get the nice

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,699
portrait bokeh effect with a blurred background using image segmentation. Now, you may be wondering

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,160
why we take this somewhat indirect approach of getting the mask of the subject, blurring the

52
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,440
entire photo, and then adding the subject back on top. For instance, what if you just used the

53
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,140
image segmentation mask to identify all the pixels of the background behind the subject and just

54
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,660
directly blur those pixels? Well, let's zoom in a bit to see what might happen. The thing is,

55
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,539
the way the blurring effect works is kind of like dipping your finger in water and then moving it

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,340
over a watercolor painting to get the pixels to mix together.

57
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,740
So if you apply the blur somewhere here, that's fine.

58
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,640
But when you try to blur the parts of the background

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,920
that border the subject, which you don't want to be blurry,

60
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,780
then you'll end up blurring the pixels of the subject as well.

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
So if you do the recommended method that you saw earlier,

62
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,520
this helps you to make sure that the person in the photo

63
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,560
doesn't have a blurry outline around them.

64
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, and one more thing.

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,679
You can actually try out image segmentation yourself

66
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,920
by going to Meta AI's website.

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,940
If you start from the Meta AI chatbot site,

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
you can click on the left-hand menu

69
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,860
and then click on AI Demos.

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,820
The AI Demos page includes a section called Segment Anything.

71
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,300
It's currently version two

72
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,580
at the time that I'm filming this.

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,760
So let's click on that.

74
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,740
Then I'll click on the button, Try It Now.

75
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,460
It starts out with a default video

76
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,980
that's about 10 seconds long,

77
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
but I'll go here and click on the button

78
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
that says Change Video.

79
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,240
And there are other videos to choose from,

80
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,620
but I'm going to drag and drop a video of my own.

81
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,500
Note that for any video that you upload, it will show about the first 9 to 10 seconds of it.

82
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,260
So I'll go ahead and click play and take a look at the video.

83
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,180
Now I'm going to pause the video so that I can click on an object to segment.

84
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,220
And in this case, I'll click on this emoji ball in my hand.

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,920
It gives me the option to add more mouse clicks to define the object that I'm interested in.

86
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,800
But this looks pretty good, so I'll just go ahead and click on the button here that says track objects.

87
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,700
After a few seconds, it starts to play the video again.

88
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,480
And you can see that the emoji ball is being outlined by a blue line.

89
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,340
So if you click on the button that says next,

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,440
it gives you some options for things that you can do with the object that you've now segmented.

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,080
For instance, you can click on erase and then gradient.

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
And you can also click on pixelate.

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,380
If you click on spotlight, it looks like it's outlining the emoji ball.

94
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,540
If you click on burst, it looks like this.

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,360
And you can actually click on emoji.

96
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,720
So in this video, it's actually replacing this emoji ball with an actual emoji.

97
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,300
and you can cycle through a couple different emojis.

98
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,320
That's pretty cool.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,940
You can also update the background,

100
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,740
and it would only affect the background and not the objects that are segmented.

101
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,620
So I'd encourage you to try it out for yourself.

102
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,180
Maybe you can find a fun video that you'd like to use to practice image segmentation.

103
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,200
Coming up next,

104
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,080
what if you took a picture of something that has text in it,

105
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,620
like an outdoor sign or a restaurant receipt,

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,500
and wanted to be able to copy that text into a text message, for instance?

107
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,480
Let's look at how to do that next.
