00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,820
You're probably familiar with personal assistants on a smartphone, computer, or home device,

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,300
such as Apple's Siri or Google's Personal Assistant or Amazon Alexa.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,980
These don't necessarily need powerful large language models to perform simple tasks,

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,320
but they combine speech recognition with language models,

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,660
as well as tools to allow you to interact with apps using just your voice.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,720
Let's go over a few ways that you might use a personal assistant on your phone.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,140
I'll be using Google Personal Assistant to demonstrate these.

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,200
If you happen to have an Android phone sitting near you, I recommend putting it a bit further

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,960
away from you so that this video lecture doesn't accidentally activate your own phone's personal

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,360
assistant.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,560
So here's an example of how you can check your calendar and add a new event to your calendar.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,880
Hey Google, what are my calendar events for tomorrow?

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,080
There are five entries tomorrow.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,520
First up, you have breakfast at Tiffany's at 8 a.m.

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,160
Here's the rest.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,120
Add a new calendar event for tomorrow from 3 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,800
What's the title of the event?

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,540
Practice juggling.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,260
Okay, practice juggling tomorrow from 3 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Do you want to save that?

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,360
Yes.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,780
Sure, I added it.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,500
Hey Google, open up my calendar to tomorrow.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,220
There are six entries for tomorrow.

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,340
First up, you have breakfast at Tiffany's at 8am.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,160
Here's the rest.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,120
And here's how you might send and edit a text message to a friend.

28
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,700
Hey Google.

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,340
Send a text message to Francis Ko.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,020
What's the message?

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,880
Hey, still up for lunch tomorrow?

32
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,660
I got, hey, still up for lunch tomorrow.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,060
Ready to send it?

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,320
No.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,840
Okay, what's the message?

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,940
Hey, are you still up for lunch tomorrow?

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,640
I got, hey, are you still up for lunch tomorrow?

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,860
Ready to send it?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,060
Sending your message to Francis Co.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:47,820
Here's how you could ask it to use a specific app, in this case Google Maps, to help you locate businesses of interest, to get driving directions, or to directly start navigating to a particular location.

41
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,360
Hey Google.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,600
Use Google Maps to locate Hollywood film studios near me.

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,040
Okay, opening Google Maps.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,300
Hey Google, get me driving directions to Disney Studios.

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,940
Hey Google, use Google Maps to get me driving directions to Disney Studios.

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Hey Google, navigate to Disney Studios.

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,860
So I'll just note here that if I did not specify Google Maps in my instruction, then

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,200
I would get slightly different results.

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,920
So you can try this out by asking the assistant to use a specific app that's installed on

50
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,660
your phone to perform your desired task.

51
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,460
For example, play music or set a reminder.

52
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,140
Coming up next, some models allow you to input prompts that are not just text, but also images

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,080
and text.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,640
These are called multimodal models.

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,700
Let's see how you can prompt with both images and text.

56
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:18,540
Next.
