1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,680
When you're taking this course, there may be points where you feel like you're getting stuck,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,540
and you may be wondering whether you need to keep studying that piece until you can move forward,

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,880
or maybe even go deeper in that subject before you move forward in the course.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,420
What I'd actually recommend to you is to keep moving forward and see the whole course first,

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,640
and that way, when you see the big picture, you'll actually have a better understanding

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,620
of some of those things that you got stuck on earlier.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's talk a little bit more about the big picture.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,100
When you're learning a new subject, there will be times when you feel unsure about something

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,920
and maybe feel a little bit stuck.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
For example, you may still be wondering, what is AI really?

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,980
It's like if you're hiking on a trail and deciding whether to stay where you are or continue walking.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,240
You might wonder if it's better to rewatch the video or maybe stop and think about it a little bit longer.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,420
Another option to consider is to keep moving forward to see what comes next in your studies.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,580
For example, while you're still pondering what AI really is, you can also learn a little bit about

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,340
computer vision, and then learn a little bit about machine translation, and then learn a lot about

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,000
chatbots. When you give yourself the permission to move forward in the rest of the curriculum,

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,980
sometimes what you learn later can help you answer some of those questions that you had earlier.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,660
And even if that's not always the case, when you move forward in your studies,

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,480
you'll learn a lot of things that may give you more confidence when you go back to address

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
some of those questions that you had earlier. As you're studying a subject such as AI,

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,640
something else you'll likely encounter is that there are many other related subjects,

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,800
so there are also many possible paths you can take in your studies. Some of these topics may

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,740
be really interesting, or you may feel that these are prerequisites that you have to study first

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,880
before you can continue on your original journey. It's great to be excited about exploring on your

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,520
own, but I also suggest that you can also explore those topics later. Usually, a course is designed

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,420
to help you focus on a certain set of topics to help you learn what's most relevant for the goals

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,480
of the course. This means intentionally leaving some content out of the course in order to let you

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,100
move forward more efficiently. Specific to AI, you may learn about or get advice about learning more

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,040
math or learning coding, or you may also hear about other important topics such as data analysis or

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,540
data science. These are definitely great to learn too, at some point, but you can learn a lot about

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,680
AI and even start using AI in some daily tasks or at work, even before you get to studying those

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,080
other topics. I think that seeing the benefits of AI first can also make it more fun if and when you

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,579
do decide to get into the math and coding, or when you decide to study other useful and related topics

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,500
such as data analysis and data science. But the reason I want to suggest that you not feel required

35
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,380
to learn those things as your first step is that too often people get stuck or discouraged when

36
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,440
studying some of those prerequisites. It's a little like getting stuck on a hiking trail that is

37
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,440
difficult and not yet very fun. So some people may wonder if it's worth it to keep going. But if they

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,519
get to see and interact with some of the cool stuff first, this will make it easier and more motivating

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,080
to keep learning. C'est comme si vous aviez la possibilitÃ© de vous placer d'abord au sommet d'une colline pour avoir une belle vue d'ensemble.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,320
of the whole trail, then when you return to the ground and hike through it on foot, you'll have a

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,000
better sense of where you're going and what to expect along the way, and also what to look forward

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,780
to when you reach your destination. Learning the math and coding will eventually help you if you

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,919
want to go deeper into the field, and I think it will be more motivating when you do learn those

44
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,820
foundational topics if you can already see the end results of all that math, code, and theory.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
So please try to get that big picture view from above and check out the cool things that you can

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,680
do with AI. When you're ready, you can still revisit the topics that you covered earlier

47
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,900
and go deeper if you want to. Next up, you'll learn about computer vision,

48
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,780
starting with how to locate and identify objects in the picture.
