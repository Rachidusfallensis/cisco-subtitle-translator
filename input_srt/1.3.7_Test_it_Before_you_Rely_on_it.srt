1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,300
If you baked a cake before serving it to your friends, you may want to test it out just to make sure it's okay.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,720
Similarly with chatbots, you may want to test it out to make sure it's doing what you expect it to do before you rely on it.

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,820
I think we're going to need to take like four or five more takes of this.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,740
Here's a web article about a kind of dog called a Shih Tzu.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,760
What if you ask a chatbot to extract relevant text about this dog's appearance,

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,020
given the web link to this article?

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,840
Ideally, it would be helpful if the chatbot pulls direct word-for-word quotes from the article

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,500
so that you can, for instance, cite the original source when writing an essay about dogs.

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,280
Let's try this out and see what happens.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,060
At first glance, it looks like it's extracted direct quotes.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,360
But let's just check this.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,880
I'll look for some keywords that I can search for inside the web article itself.

13
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
For instance, I'll look for the phrase double-layered.

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,360
Back in the web article, I'm searching for the word double, and I don't find double-layered.

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,260
The closest I find is double-coat.

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,380
Let me go back to the chatbot's output and check for another word.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,760
It describes the eyes of this dog as almond-shaped.

18
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,700
So I'll look for the word almond in the original article to check if it's quoting directly from the article.

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,140
In the original source, I'm searching for the word almond, and this word doesn't actually appear in the article at all.

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,900
So is the chatbot doing what I asked it to do in this case? Not quite.

21
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,260
Even though the chatbot responds that here's the relevant text extracted from this article, it looks like it's not actually doing that.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,160
It's possibly paraphrasing this article or using its own knowledge to generate its output.

23
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,420
Let's try another chatbot host. You can use the Hugging Chat website and also choose Meta's

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,320
Llama model. Hugging Chat also lets you choose some options. One is Fetch URL and the other is

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Web Search. The one I really want to be using here is Fetch URL because it's going to look at a

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,459
specific web page that I'm specifying with a web link. I'll go ahead and give it the same prompt

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,640
And when I run this, notice that it shows this message, called tool fetch URL.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,660
You'll learn more about tools later in this course, but this message indicates that Hugging

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,060
Chat is going to the web link that I gave in the prompt and is reading through the text

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,440
on that site in order to perform the task that I requested.

31
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Now the chatbot's output says, here is the relevant text, and it also outputs a paragraph

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,000
of text surrounded by quotation marks.

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,600
You can check some keywords to see if these are coming from the original article.

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,080
For instance, I will check if owlhead appears in the original article.

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,040
And it looks like it does.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,540
Next, I can check if double coat is a phrase in the original article.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,100
And it is.

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
So is the chatbot doing what I asked it to do?

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,860
In this case, yes, it looks like it is.

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,140
So it helps to keep in mind that before you trust the chatbot to perform a kind of task,

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,960
it might help to first give it a slightly simpler version of that task that's easy enough for you to

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,280
check and verify first. Just because a chatbot says that it's performing a task that you requested

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,540
doesn't necessarily mean that it's doing so correctly. Coming up next, you'll get an overview

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,160
of general tips for how to write your prompts that you can apply to all the use cases that

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,220
you'll see in the rest of the course. Let's check that out next.
